This directory contains instructions for obtaining and formatting the data used in the dissertation. These instructions are based on [Aaron Ecay's](http://aaronecay.com/) work with [Meredith Tamminga](http://meredithtamminga.com/), which can be found on [github](https://github.com/aecay/digs15-negative-priming). I'd like to thank both of them for doing such good reproducible research, and Aaron in particular for sharing his time and expertise in helping me understand and use the corpus data. Below are instructions for replicating the data used in the dissertation.
