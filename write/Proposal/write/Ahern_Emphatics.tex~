\title{Emphatic Negation}

\section{Emphasis}

Emphatic negation is used to signal something beyond ordinary negation, often through the addition of some negative polarity item. The effect can be characterized along two dimensions \citep{kadmon-landman1993any}. 

First, there is a reduced tolerance to exceptions. For example, in the case of a cook making dinner for a large group of people, the amount of potatoes that would be relevant is quite large. 

  \ex. \a. Will there be French fries tonight?
       \b. No, I don't have potatoes.
       \b. Maybe you have just a couple of potatoes that I could fry in my room.
       \b. Sorry, I don't have \textsc{any} potatoes.

The emphasis \emph{widens} the interpretation of potatoes from quantities relevant to a large group to quantities relevant to a single person. The cook doesn't have even this smaller quanitity.

Second, emphasis yields a semantically stronger statement. For example, in the case of an order to stay put, the latter entails the former.

  \ex. \a. If you move, I'll hit you.
       \b. If you budge an inch, I'll hit you.

We can compare the situations where the threat is carried out.  We would expect that all instances under the latter would entail the former, but not vice versa. That is, budging an inch entails moving, but budging an inch does not entail moving under some given contextual standard. In this sense, emphasis \emph{strengthens} the interpretation of the asserted proposition.

\cite{krifka1995polarity} develops a compositional account of these effects that takes emphatic negation to result from an NPI occuring in emphatic focus. NPIs introduce alternatives and that these alternatives are ordered according to semantic specificity. NPIs pick out the low end of a particular scale, and are thus the most specific possible statement. Emphatic focus indicates that the asserted proposition is unlikely in comparison to its alternatives. Taken together, these components allow for the effects of emphatic negation to be derived pragmatically. We take this analysis as a starting point and consider how speakers and hearers might reason about the meaning of emphatic negation over time.

\section{Analysis}

Suppose that speakers have some state of knowledge about the world. We can take these to be some contextual standard of usage. So, concerning our second example, a speaker might say either of the following.

  \ex. \a. I didn't move.
       \b. I didn't budge an inch.

In all of the cases where a speaker might reasonably assert the second, he should also be able to assert the first. We can think of the standard of usage as a kind of scale. The minimal standard of usage corresponds to the low end of the scale, and the scale is bounded from above by some absolute measure. So, for example, we could think about moving an inch as being the low end of the scale and staying absolutely still as the high end. In general, we will treat these scales as intervals $T = [0,1]$.

We might ask what the distribution over the set of states is. We can characterize this given the logical relation between any two states $t < t'$. Namely, $t'$ entails $t$,  $t' \subseteq t$.  From this we also know that the probability of the more specific state is lower, $P(t') \leq P(t)$. A general class of distributions that satisfies this requirement is the beta distribution where $\beta > \alpha=1$. As a particular example, consider the case where $\alpha=1$ and $\beta = 2$. In this case, the probability density function over states is given by the following.

\begin{equation}
     f(x) = 2(1-x)
\end{equation}

In visual terms, the probability density function is a triangle that slopes downwards. The higher states are less likely than the lower states. Note that this also give substance to the intuition that emphatic negation is somehow more informative. That is, in information-theoretic terms, being able to convey that some less likely state occurs is technically more informative.

Now, given that speakers have some knowledge about the state of the world, we can consider how they might use signal these different states. Intuitively, some plain form is used for the low end of the scale, while some emphatic form is used for the high end. Throughout we will suppose that there are distinct forms at the disposal of the speaker. Minimally, we will consider the set $M = \{m, m' \}$. We will think of senders adopting some threshold for using the two signals. For example, using $m$ if the state is below some threshold and $m'$ if it is above.

We can now consider the interpretation of a given signal from the perspective of the hearer. First, we might ask what the hearer is trying to do. This, of course, depends on what the speaker is trying to do. Often an assertion is taken as a move to add some proposition to the common ground of the interlocutors. Here we do not take the addition of a proposition to the common ground to be an all or nothing affair. That is, hearers never blindly accept an assertion without reservation. Rather, hearers are in the business of inferring the relevant state of affairs given the signal. Speakers now this, and are in the business of using linguistic signals to try to influence what is actually inferred.  We can think of the actions available to the hearer in parallel to those of the speaker. That is, each hearer is trying to infer the original state of affairs that prompted the speakers choice of signal in the first place, $A = [0,1]$. 

Given these components, we can ask what sorts of preferences speakers and hearers might have over outcomes. Intuitively, we might expect both speakers and hearers to prefer that the actual state of affairs and the state of affairs inferred by the hearer be close to each other. For example, suppose that both speakers and hearers wish to minimize the distance between the two. We might ask if there is a pair of behaviors for speaker and hearer that satisfy this joint goal. In other words, is there some split of the space that neither the speaker nor the hearer can deviate from?

This depends on what speakers and hearers do. First, suppose that there is some $t$ such that speakers send one signal when the actual state is above it and another when the actual state is below. How should receivers respond to this behavior? Well, given that they have some information about the state of the world, but are uncertain about the actual details, they should take the action that minimizes the distance between states and actions. In both cases, this means taking the action represented by the expected value conditional upon receiving a particular message. Now, given these responses, we can ask whether the sender has an incentive to deviate from the original partition. This is true just in case there is some alternative partition that would do better.

We can solve for the partition from which neither sender nor receiver will deviate as follows.

\begin{equation}

     t^* = \frac{1}{2}(E[m] + E[m'])
\end{equation}
