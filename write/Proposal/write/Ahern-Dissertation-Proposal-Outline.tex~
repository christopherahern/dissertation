\section{Cycles}
\label{Cycles}

\subsection{Jespersen's Cycle}
Broad cross-linguistic change in the expression of sentential negation \cite{vanGelderen2008negative}. In French, it's most widely cited form:

\ex. ne $\longrightarrow$ ne...(pas) $\longrightarrow$ ne...pas  $\longrightarrow$ (ne)...pas $\longrightarrow$ pas\\

\begin{enumerate}
 \item  preverbal negation
  \item optional embracing negation
  \item obligatory embracing negation
  \item optional preverbal negation
  \item postverbal negation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Motivations}
\subsubsection{Emphasis}
The cycle is motivated by the distinction between plain and emphatic negation. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Start off with distinct forms of plain and emphatic negation
  \item Emphatic negation is overused and ceases to convey emphasis
  \item ``To emphasize everything is to emphasize nothing'' \citep{kiparsky-condoravdi:2006}
\end{itemize}
What is emphatic negation? \cite{eckardt2006}, drawing on a variation of \cite{krifka1995polarity}.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Emphatic negation is the result of emphatic focus of an NPI in the scope of negation.
  \item Focus evokes alternatives \citep{rooth1992focus}
  \item NPIs denote minimal quantitites
  \item Ann did not drink $[$ a single drop $]_f \longrightarrow$ $\{$ 'Ann did not drink a glassful of anything', 'Anna did not drink a barrelful of anything'...$\}$
  \item Scalar implicature (technically, presupposition) arises that this is the most `striking' among the salient alternatives.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Information Structure}
The cycle is not necessarily motivated by the distinction between plain and emphatic negation, but the different forms of negation are sensitive to information structural constraints (Catalan, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese)\citep{schwenter2005,schwenter2006}. 


\ex. \label{bp} \a. A Cl\'audia \emph{n\~ao} veio a festa. \hfill (\textsc{Neg1})\\
           \b. A Cl\'audia \emph{n\~ao} veio a festa \emph{n\~ao}. \hfill (\textsc{Neg2})\\
	   \b. A Cl\'audia veio a festa \emph{n\~ao}. \hfill (\textsc{Neg3})\\
	    `Cl\'audia didn't come to the party.'\\

\textsc{Neg2} cannot appear discourse new (by implication, nor can \textsc{Neg3}):
\exg. Voc\^e n\~ao viu esse programma (\#n\~ao)!\\
      you neg saw that program (neg) \\
      \label{tv} `You didn't watch that program!'\\

\textsc{Neg2} can be used with activated propositions, as can \textsc{Neg1}:
\ex. \label{tvdial}\a. Voc\^e  viu esse programma?\\
      you saw that program \\
      `Did you watch that show?'
     \b. N\~ao vi (n\~ao).\\
      neg saw neg\\
       `I didn't watch it.'

\textsc{Neg2} can be used with inferrable propositions, but \textsc{Neg3} cannot:
\ex.  \a. Voc\^e  gostou da palestra da Maria?\\
      you liked of.the talk of.the Maria \\
      `Did you like Maria's talk?'
     \b. Eu (n\~ao) gostei n\~ao.\\
      I (neg) liked neg\\
      \label{d-old} `I didn't like it.'
     \b. Eu \#(n\~ao) fui n\~ao.\\
      I (neg) went neg\\
       \label{inf} `I didn't go.'

\begin{table}[ht]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cccc@{}}
      \hline
       &\textsc{discourse new} & \textsc{inferable} & \textsc{discourse old} \\
      \hline
      (\textsc{Neg1}) \textsc{n V} & \checkmark & \checkmark &  \checkmark \\
      (\textsc{Neg2}) \textsc{n V n} & \# & \checkmark & \checkmark \\
      (\textsc{Neg3}) \textsc{V n} & \# & \# & \checkmark \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\caption{Discourse-Status Constraints on Forms of Negation}
\label{discourse}
  \end{table}


\begin{itemize}
 \item Different forms signal different discourse functions
 \item Change requires a loosening of the constraints
 \item This seems to be happening in Brazilian Portuguese \citep{schwenter2005}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Testing}
\subsubsection{Outline}
Both motivations can be thought of in terms of the model.
\begin{itemize}
     \item Types form a scale
     \item Least salient alternative is low type, most salient alternative is high type
     \item Discourse new is low type, inferrable is middle type, activated/discourse old is high type
     \item Prior probability for different types can be estimated
     \item Incentive to ``exaggerate'' type, or just failure to track interlocutor's mental state
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operationalizing}

\begin{itemize}
     \item Track occurrences of `pas' as part of emphatic negation versus as NPI in general, and as `step' over time.
     \item Does `ne...pas' cease to be emphatic  at some point? How can we tell structurally? or otherwise?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
     \item Compare sentences with negation to previous (\cite{wallage2013} for Middle English)
     \item This is a subjective measure, don't have ye olde native speaker intuitions or cultural knowledge
     \item Indirect measure: referring expressions that respond to discourse status \citep{gundel-etal1993}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questions/Concerns}

\begin{itemize}
     \item What is the nature of the type spaces according to the two models? Are they discrete or continuous? What is the probability distribution over types?
     \item Is it reasonable to assume a conflict? What is the interpretation for each model?
     \item Do we have enough data to test the different predictions of the two analyses?
     \item What are the implications for acquisition?
     \item What do they have to say about (relative) stability? (compare Middle English to Middle French)
\end{itemize}
