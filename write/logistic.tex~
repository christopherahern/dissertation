\title{Solving a logistic growth equation with varying growth rate}
\date{}

\maketitle

I'm working with a differential equation that is a logistic growth function with a carrying capacity and a varying growth rate, where $p, \alpha, \beta \in [0,1]$.

\begin{equation}
\dot{p} = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{(1-p)\alpha + p\beta}
\end{equation}
The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ determine the sign of the growth rate. If $\beta > \alpha$ then the growth rate is positive, if $\beta < \alpha$ then the growth rate is negative.

Integrating and taking antilogarithms we get the following, where $K$ comes from a constant of integration. 

\begin{equation}
 \frac{p^\alpha}{(1-p)^\beta} = Ke^{(\beta - \alpha)t}
\end{equation}
I'm not sure how to use this to find a particular solution for $p$. In particular, I'm not sure how to deal with the exponents. Is there a straightforward way to solve for $p$? I'm at a loss of how to go about solving this.

One potential insight can be found from bounds on the original differential equation. Namely, assuming for now that $\beta > \alpha$, we know that the original differential equation exhibits a growth rate between the following two differential equations.

\begin{equation}
\dot{p}_\alpha = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{\alpha}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dot{p}_\beta = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta}
\end{equation}
We can visualize these as in Figure \ref{logistic-plot}. The growth rate of the original differential equation is always between the other two. Intuitively, this means that any solution to $\dot{p}$ will be between the solutions to $\dot{p}_\alpha$ and $\dot{p}_\beta$. Interestingly as $\alpha$ and $\beta$ become closer together, the differential equation with the varying growth rate starts to look like the average of the other two.

\begin{equation}
    \lim_{\alpha \rightarrow \beta} \dot{p} = \frac{1}{2}(\dot{p}_\alpha + \dot{p}_\beta)
\end{equation}

For a growth rate, $\gamma$, the solution to the logistic is the following, where $K$ results from a constant of integration.

\begin{equation}
     p_\gamma = \frac{Ke^{\gamma t}}{1 + Ke^{\gamma t}}
\end{equation}
Where $p(0) = p_0$, $K = \left( \frac{p_0}{1-p_o} \right)$, we have the following form for a particular solution.

\begin{equation}
     p_\gamma = \frac{\left( \frac{p_0}{1-p_o} \right)e^{\gamma t}}{1 + \left( \frac{p_0}{1-p_o} \right)e^{\gamma t}}
\end{equation}
We can visualize these two solutions, as in Figure \ref{solution-plot}.

% 
% $p = \frac{Ke^{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}t}}{Ke^{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}t} + e^t}$
% 
% $p = \frac{Ke^t}{Ke^t + e^{\frac{\alpha}{\beta}t}}$
% 
% If $\beta > \alpha$ then the growth rate for the first simplified equation is always greater than the second simplified equation, and the solution to the original equation will be somewhere in between these two. Is there a straightforward way to interpolate between these two solutions?
