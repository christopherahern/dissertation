This dissertation advances our understanding of the roles played by pragmatic and grammatical competence in theories of language change by applying mathematical and statistical methods to the cross-linguistic change in the expression of negation known as Jespersenâ€™s cycle. In the history of Middle English this change is characterized by two transitions: the first is from pre-verbal \emph{ne} to an initially emphatic embracing \emph{ne...not}; the second is from embracing \emph{ne...not} to post-verbal \emph{not}.  This description conflates two often related process. The formal cycle describes changes in the forms of negation available and consists of the transitions from pre-verbal to embracing to post-verbal negation. The functional cycle describes changes in how forms are used to signal meaning and consists of the transition from pre-verbal to embracing negation. While these two processes often overlap, the functional cycle can occur independently of the formal cycle. This informs the structure of the dissertation where we address the functional and formal cycles in turn.

Using tools from evolutionary game theory, we show that the functional cycle is driven by limits on our pragmatic competence. In Middle English the incoming embracing form is initially restricted to negating propositions that are common information between interlocutors because they have recently been introduced to or can be inferred from the preceding discourse. But, experimental evidence shows that speakers have difficulty in distinguishing between common and privileged information. Speakers use the initially restricted form in more and more contexts that are less and less closely tied to the discourse. As the form increases in frequency it loses the information it carried, undergoing a kind of bleaching.

% The result is a semantico-pragmatic push chain where the incoming embracing form  displaces the pre-verbal form of negation as it increases in frequency.

Applying statistical methods developed in population genetics to a corpus of Middle English, we show that grammatical competence 


Turning to the formal cycle, the transition from pre-verbal to embracing negation has been argued to set the stage for the second transition in the formal cycle. However, we show that acquisition cannot account for such a transition unless it is simply the result of the accumulation of small random changes.  

Applying statistical methods developed in population genetics to a corpus of Middle English, I show that this is indeed a possibility. The second transition is not distinguishable from random drift observed in finite biological populations. In contrast, we can reject the possibility of drift in the first transition. This result is surprising insofar as it demonstrates that the causes of linguistic change are not readily observed from their form. Our visual intuitions about \emph{S}-shaped curves should be treated with caution. 

% However, the random nature of the second transition allows us to make sense of its varying length across languages, from a century or so in Middle English and Middle High German to several centuries and more in French and different dialects of Dutch. Indeed, this is exactly what we would expect if the second transition was the result of random drift.

% is the cross-linguistic change from pre-verbal to embracing to post-verbal negation known as Jespersen's Cycle. Using tools from evolutionary game theory, I show that the first transition in the cycle, from pre-verbal to embracing negation, is driven by the difficulty speakers have in keeping track of privileged versus common information.  For example, in Middle English the incoming embracing form, \emph{ne...not}, is initially restricted to negating propositions that are common information because they have recently been introduced to or can be inferred from the preceding discourse. But, speakers use this form in more and more contexts that are less and less closely tied to the discourse. As the form increases in use it loses the information it carried, undergoing a kind of bleaching. In fact, as the embracing form becomes the only one in use it ceases to carry any additional information about the negated proposition and the previous discourse. The result is a semantico-pragmatic push chain where the incoming embracing form  displaces the pre-verbal form of negation as it increases in frequency.
