\title{Solving a logistic growth equation}
\date{}

\maketitle

I'm working with a differential equation that is a logistic growth function with a carrying capacity and a varying growth rate, where $p, \alpha, \beta \in [0,1]$.

\begin{equation}
\frac{dp}{dt} = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{(1-p)\alpha + p\beta}
\end{equation}
The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ determine the sign of the growth rate. If $\beta > \alpha$ then the growth rate is positive, if $\beta < \alpha$ then the growth rate is negative.

Integrating and taking antilogarithms we get the following, where $K$ comes from a constant of integration. 

\begin{equation}
 \frac{p^\alpha}{(1-p)^\beta} = Ke^{(\beta - \alpha)t}
\end{equation}
 
I'm not sure how to use this to find a particular solution for $p$. In particular, I'm not sure how to deal with the exponents. Is there a straightforward way to solve for $p$? 

One potential insight can be found from bounds on the original 

simplify the denominator in the growth rate of the original equation and consider the two simplified equations.

$\frac{dp}{dt} = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{\alpha}$

$\frac{dp}{dt} = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta}$

with particular solutions where $K =\frac{p_0}{(1-p_0)}$

$p = \frac{Ke^{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}t}}{Ke^{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}t} + e^t}$

$p = \frac{Ke^t}{Ke^t + e^{\frac{\alpha}{\beta}t}}$

If $\beta > \alpha$ then the growth rate for the first simplified equation is always greater than the second simplified equation, and the solution to the original equation will be somewhere in between these two. Is there a straightforward way to interpolate between these two solutions?
