This dissertation advances our understanding of the roles played by pragmatics and syntax in language change by applying novel mathematical and statistical methods to the cross-linguistic change in the expression of negation known as Jespersen’s cycle. In the history of Middle English this change is characterized by two transitions: the first is from pre-verbal "ne" to an initially emphatic embracing "ne...not"; the second is from embracing "ne...not" to post-verbal "not".  This description conflates two often related process. The formal cycle describes changes in the forms of negation available and consists of the transitions from pre-verbal to embracing to post-verbal negation. The functional cycle describes changes in how forms are used to signal meaning and consists of the transition from pre-verbal to embracing negation. While these two processes often overlap, the functional cycle can occur independently of the formal cycle. This informs the structure of the dissertation where we address the functional and formal cycles in turn.

Using tools from evolutionary game theory, we show that the functional cycle is driven by the difficulty speakers have in keeping track of privileged versus common information.  In Middle English the incoming embracing form is initially restricted to negating propositions that are common information between interlocutors because they have recently been introduced to or can be inferred from the preceding discourse. But, experimental evidence shows that speakers have difficulty in distinguishing between common and privileged information. Speakers use the initially restricted form in more and more contexts that are less and less closely tied to the discourse. As the form increases in frequency it loses the information it carried, undergoing a kind of bleaching. As the embracing form becomes the only one in use it ceases to carry any additional information about the negated proposition and the previous discourse. The result is a semantico-pragmatic push chain where the incoming embracing form  displaces the pre-verbal form of negation as it increases in frequency.

Turning to the formal cycle, the transition from pre-verbal to embracing negation has been argued to set the stage for the second transition in the formal cycle. However, we show that acquisition cannot account for such a transition unless it is simply the result of the accumulation of small random changes.  

Applying statistical methods developed in population genetics to a corpus of Middle English, I show that this is indeed a possibility. The second transition is not distinguishable from random drift observed in finite biological populations. In contrast, we can reject the possibility of drift in the first transition. This result is surprising insofar as it demonstrates that the causes of linguistic change are not readily observed from their form. Our visual intuitions about \emph{S}-shaped curves should be treated with caution. However, the random nature of the second transition allows us to make sense of its varying length across languages, from a century or so in Middle English and Middle High German to several centuries and more in French and different dialects of Dutch. Indeed, this is exactly what we would expect if the second transition was the result of random drift.

-Need an articulated notion of pragmatic competence that governs how the linguistic forms made available by grammatical competence are put to use




The line of research proposed makes the following contributions. First, it generalizes the Gricean program of understanding the use of linguistic expressions not just as something all or most happen to do, but as something that it is reasonable for us to do. Second, it incorporates this perspective into the use of linguistic signals over time. In particular, it suggests how Grice’s criterion of reasonability might cut both ways, predicting both stability and change. This adds to a broader causal theory of language change by offering an additional internal force, which derives from a shared pragmatic competence. In the case of Jespersen’s Cycle it suggests how morphosyntactic change might arise through a kind of communicative bleaching. More broadly, it offers insight into the diachronic interaction between use and acquisition. 



Language change is evidenced by a difference between the linguistic expressions of one generation and the next. Given that the output from one generation serves as the input to the next, both language acquisition and use are crucial to the process of change. In the Gricean tradition, use has been characterized as a kind of cooperative effort towards a common conversational goal. This dissertation proposes to loosen the assumption of commonality and consider the impact on linguistic signals over time. To do so we focus on a diachronic process that implicates both use and acquisition, the development in the expression of negation known as Jespersen's Cycle (1917). The cycle, observed in the history of both English (ne > ne...not > not) and French (ne > ne...pas > pas), inter alia, consists of two major transitions, which are addressed in turn. 

First, we consider how the expression of negation transitions from a purely pre-verbal negator with an optional emphatic post-verbal element towards a system with obligatory pre- and post-verbal elements. We present a formal model that derives this transition from a slight bias for exaggeration on the part of speakers, argued to be a corollary of the inferential nature of communication. If speakers prefer hearers' response to the emphatic form, then the optional post-verbal element will increase in use. On the way up it experiences a kind rhetorical devaluation and is bleached of its emphatic force. The dynamics of the model suggest a conception of this first transition in the cycle as a kind of semantico-pragmatic push-chain, whereby the introduction of a new emphatic form and its subsequent devaluation push the old form out of use.

Second, we consider how the expression of negation can shift to the new  increasingly-used post-verbal element, allowing for the subsequent loss of the pre-verbal element. We outline the conditions under which a learner would posit that the post-verbal element is a negator in its own right. We show that the pragmatic pressures implicated in the first transition are not sufficient to bring about this second transition. Rather, there must be independent evidence that the pre-verbal element appears in contexts where it does not itself express negation. We compare these predictions to the trajectory of the cycle in Middle English and suggest further explorations.
