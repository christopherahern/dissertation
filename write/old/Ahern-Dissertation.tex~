\chapter{Introduction}

Language change is evidenced by a difference between the linguistic expressions of one generation and the next. Given that the output from one generation serves as the input to the next, both language acquisition and use are crucial to the process of change. While the input to acquisition arises from the interplay of many factors, it is not arbitrary. Rather, it is governed by a \emph{pragmatic competence} that ``underlies the ability to use [\emph{grammatical competence}] along with the conceptual system to achieve certain ends or purposes'' \citep[59]{chomsky1980rules}. In the terms of \cite{chomsky1986knowledge}, the process of language acquisition maps the \emph{E-Language} of one generation to the \emph{I-Language} of the next, whereas pragmatic competence is what governs the mapping from each generation's \emph{I-Language} to its \emph{E-Language}.

In the Gricean tradition \citep{Grice:1975, Levinson:1983, Horn:1984}, this pragmatic competence has been framed in terms of speakers' beliefs, preferences, and intentions. Linguistic expressions are used according to a \emph{Cooperative Principle} whereby interlocutors are taken to make the appropriate contribution to the conversation at the appropriate time towards ``the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange'' \citep[26]{Grice:1975}. This framework deftly captures the systematic relationship between what is \emph{said} and what is \emph{meant}, but is clearly an idealization: speakers and hearers might, but need not have the same preferences or goals in a given exchange.   This dissertation aims at understanding the consequences of loosening the assumption of Gricean commonality. It will examine how differences in speakers' and hearers' preferences might impact the use and acquisition of linguistic signals over time. 

At the center of this endeavor will be a diachronic process that implicates both use and acquisition, the development in the expression of negation over time known as \emph{Jespersen's Cycle} \citeyearpar{jespersen:1917}. The main components of this dissertation address the main components of the cycle in turn. First, we consider how the expression of negation transitions from a purely preverbal negator with an optional \emph{emphatic} postverbal element towards a system with obligatory preverbal and postverbal elements. We present a formal model that derives this transition from even a slight preference for exaggeration on the part of speakers. If speakers prefer hearers' response to the emphatic form, then the optional postverbal element will increase in use. On the way up it experiences a kind of \emph{rhetorical devaluation} \citep{dahl:2001}, and is at least partially \emph{bleached} of its emphatic force because, simply put, to ``to emphasize everything is to emphasize nothing'' \citep{kiparsky-
condoravdi:2006}. Second, we consider how the expression of negation can shift from the original preverbal negator to the new, increasingly-used, postverbal element. We outline the conditions under which a learner would posit that the postverbal element is a negator in its own right. If the preverbal element appears in contexts where it does not itself express negation, this provides evidence that postverbal element expresses negation and for the eventual loss of the preverbal element entirely. We consider the interaction between these two components of the cycle.

The main contributions of this line of research are the following. First,  it extends recent work in game-theoretic pragmatics that has begun to explore the broader space of possibly divergent preferences \citep{benz-jager-van-rooij:2006, franke:2008, franke-etal:2012, de-jaegher-van-rooij:2013}. This can be taken as a straightforward generalization of the Gricean program to understand the use of linguistic expressions not just as something ``all or most do \emph{in fact} follow but as something that it is \emph{reasonable} for us to follow, that we \emph{should not} abandon'' \citep[29]{Grice:1975}.  Second, it incorporates this perspective into the use of linguistic signals over time. In particular, it suggests how Grice's criterion of reasonability might cut both ways: there are some patterns of use that we \emph{should} and \emph{do} abandon. Differentiating the cases where we expect stability from those where we expect change adds to a broader causal theory of language change \citep{yang2000internal}. 


Namely, it offers an additional \emph{internal} force of language change, which derives from a shared pragmatic competence. In the case of Jespersen's Cycle it suggests how morphosyntactic change might arise through a kind of communicative bleaching.   More broadly, it offers insight into the interaction between use and acquisition implicit in the common representation of iterated language change as in Figure \ref{trans}.

The rest of the proposal is structured as follows. Section \ref{Background} offers an overview of Jespersen's Cycle.  We consider the two major approaches to the change, as a \emph{pull-chain} or a \emph{push-chain}. We adopt the latter given that the driving force behind the cycle appears to be pragmatic in nature, stemming from continuous loss and renewal of emphatic negation. We then consider a natural simplification of Eckardt's \citeyear{eckardt2006} analysis of emphatic negation. In Section \ref{Signaling} we develop the mathematical framework that will be used to explicitly connect the analysis of emphatic negation with the cycle. In Section \ref{Cycles} we apply the framework and consider the cycle as a signaling game played in a population where the interests of speakers and hearers slightly diverge. We determine the conditions for the existence of different kinds of equilibria, and the impact of the introduction of new signals under the game dynamics. Finally, in Section \ref{Stability} we 
determine how the change brought about by use might impact acquisition over time. We suggest different mechanisms that might impact the amount of evidence available to learners at various points in time and how this shapes the trajectory of the change.

	   I am, however, enough of a rationalist to want to find a basis that underlies these facts, undeniable though they may be; I would like to be able to think of the standard type of conversational practice not merely as something that all or most do \textbf{in fact} follow but as something that it is \textbf{reasonable} for us to follow, that \textbf{we should not abandon}. 
 \end{quote}           

\begin{quote}
As one of my avowed aims is to see talking as a special case or variety of purposive, indeed rational, behaviour, it may be worth noting that the specific expectations or presumptions connected with at least some of the foregoing maxims have their analogues in the sphere of transactions that are not talk exchanges. (Grice 1989, p. 28)
\end{quote}

Conflicts of interest play markedly different roles in Linguistics and Biology. On the one hand, Gricean pragmatics has aimed at understanding the inferences that a listener can draw from a speaker's contribution on the explicit assumption of a shared set of purposes for an exchange. On the other hand, animal signaling has aimed at understanding the existence and persistence of signaling systems in the face of varying degrees of inter- and intra-species conflict.  Both endeavors hinge on the role of conflict, either in its presence or absence. Yet, in the abstract, both deal with the transmission and interpretation of signals. This leads us to consider what happens when we extend our linguistic considerations beyond perfectly aligned interests. 

At first glance, this step outside the idealized realm of common causes yields some forbidding results: conflicts of interest erode communication. The following reasoning, familiar from biological studies of animal signaling, makes clear the root of this unraveling \citep{searcy-nowicki:2005}. Imagine two agents: a sender who sends a signal and a receiver who receives the signal. Suppose that the sender has no incentive to be truthful, in fact, let us suppose that he has every incentive to deceive the receiver. If the sender has an incentive to deceive, then the receiver should not listen. If the receiver does not listen, then the sender has no motive to signal in the first place. Crucially, the actions of the sender depend on those of the receiver and vice versa. Given this interdependence, conflicting interests undermine the information conveyed by signals, rendering them, so to speak, meaningless. 

The same reasoning holds in the case of an entire population of senders and receivers interacting over time. Senders will learn or evolve to dissimulate and receivers will learn or evolve to distrust. This process takes on the familiar form of the \emph{tragedy of the commons} \citep{hardin:1968}. Individuals will always be tempted to exploit the common resource of credulity. Collectively, this incentive to exploit exhausts the resource. Only a fool would tell the truth when there is something to be gained from deception, and only a fool would trust others to be truthful. 


\begin{quote}
	   Make your conversational contribution  such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged. One might label this the \textbf{Cooperative Principle}.
\end{quote}           


Silence, or at best meaningless babble, is the equilibrium state in the population: neither senders nor receivers have reason to unilaterally change their behavior. Thomas Schelling's grim pronouncement comes to mind \citep[26]{schelling:1978}:  

\begin{quote}
 The body of a hanged man is in equilibrium when it finally stops swinging, but
nobody is going to insist that the man is all right.
\end{quote}
This sentiment holds doubly. Not only is the inability to convey information problematic, but, we do actually observe informative signaling. The existence of such signaling despite conflicting interests is a genuine puzzle. 

This problem was not lost on Grice, insofar as he recognized the fundamental
role of his \emph{Maxim of Quality} to the entire enterprise.

\begin{quotation}
It is obvious that the observance of some of these maxims is a matter of less urgency than is the observance of others; a man who has expressed himself with undue prolixity would, in general, be open to milder comment than would a man who has said something he believes to be false...[O]ther maxims come into operation only on the assumption that this maxim of Quality is satisfied \citep[27]{Grice:1975}
\end{quotation}

Yet, while we have every incentive to abide by the maxim of Quality when it serves our interests, we have every reason to do otherwise when it does not. So, what keeps human language from the downward spiral to silence? In this regard we can look to animal communication where much work has been devoted to explaining the evolutionary stability of communication. In large part, these solutions take the form of different mechanisms that mitigate conflicts of interest between senders and receivers. 

For example, a sender might guarantee his commitment to the truth by incurring a sufficiently high cost to send a signal. This \emph{handicap principle}  \citep{Zahavi:1975} allows for stable signaling despite conflicting interests.\footnote{See \cite{maynard-smith-harper:2004} and \cite{searcy-nowicki:2005} for thorough discussions of handicaps in animal signaling. Also,\cite{grose:2011} offers a concise but useful discussion of the history and details of the handicap principle. In the economic tradition, \cite{spence:1973} develops a parallel model for educational attainment as a costly signal of job suitability.} To take the usual example, a peacock incurs a cost for his magnificent tail: significant metabolic resources are required to develop the tail, and once developed, his ability to fly is hampered and it makes him more conspicuous to predators. But, successfully bearing the tail serves as a signal of his genetic worth. A weaker peacock would not have been able to support the tail and avoid becoming 
something else's lunch. Thus, potential mates  can take the tail as a signal of a a truly fit peacock. 

When we turn our attention to language, this sort of mechanism need not be appropriate.  In fact, the notion that truthfulness is enforced by cost is problematic: truth tellers expend as much effort learning and producing their language as liars, and no more. As we say, talk is cheap. There are, of course, various alternatives to handicaps that are appropriate for the case of language \citep{scott-phillips:2008}. A particularly appealing alternative given the social nature of humans, and language, is that of reputation. The minimal requirements for a reputation are the ability of agents to recognize each other individually, keep track of past interactions, and condition future behavior on the outcome of those interactions \citep{Trivers:1971}. In the long run, the immediate benefits of deception might not be worth the consequences of a bad reputation.

Abstracting away from the details of the actual mechanisms that mitigate conflict, we can consider three general questions.  First, how effective are these mechanisms in aligning the interests of senders and receivers? Given that language exists, such mechanisms are clearly sufficient to stave off total collapse. However, given that signals are not always used in accordance with the Maxim of Quality, such mechanism are not sufficient to ensure the idealized case of Gricean commonality. Second, if language is indeed subject to a host of competing pressures, what impact will this have on how linguistic signals are used over time?  If not a tragedy of the commons, might we find a lesser \emph{tragedy of the conversation} where particular signals, but not the system as a whole, are destabilized? Third, do we find instantiations of the predicted patterns of language use? In what follows, these second two question will be our chief concern.

\section{Function}

\section{Causes}

Originally coined by \cite{dahl:1979}, \emph{Jespersen's Cycle} refers to an observation of the expression of negation over time for several European languages. While more recent work has established its cross-linguistic prevalence \citep{vanGelderen2008negative}, the most widely-cited form of the  cycle can be drawn from Jespersen's original observations of, among others, English and French. 

The first stage is that of purely preverbal negation. This is seen in Old English and Old French, where ``ne'' expresses negation alone.

\exg. Ic ne secge\\
      I neg say\\
      (Old English)

\exg. Jeo ne dis\\
      I neg say\\
      (Old French)

This is followed by a stage of embracing or bipartite negation where a postverbal negative reinforcer is added. This is seen in Middle English and Middle French, where ``ne'' is reinforced by ``not'' and ``pas'' in the two languages.


\exg. I ne seye not\\
      I neg say neg\\
      (Middle English)

\exg. Je ne dis pas\\
      I neg say neg\\
      (Middle French)

Finally, there is the stage of purely postverbal negation. This is seen in Early Modern English and Present-day Colloquial French, where ``ne'' is lost.

\exg. I say not\\
      I say neg\\
      (Early Modern English)

\exg. Je dis pas\\
      I say neg\\
      (Present-day Colloquial French)


A more articulated model captures the intuition that there are transitions between these stages \citep{vanderAuwera2009}. That is, between the purely preverbal and embracing negation there is a period of optional embracing negation; between the obligatory embracing negation and purely post-verbal negation there is a period of optional embracing negation. Where parentheses are taken to indicate optionality, the stages can be represented schematically as the following.

\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}
     \item \textsc{n V}
    \item \textsc{n V (n)}
    \item \textsc{n V n}
    \item \textsc{(n) V n}
    \item \textsc{ V n}
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}
Note that this does not preclude the coexistence of all three forms synchronically. For example, we do indeed find instances of all three forms in variation: \textsc{n V} $\sim$ \textsc{n V n} $\sim$ \textsc{V n} \citep{schwenter2005, schwenter2006}. We might then, at least for the moment, consider this a general trajectory over time.

In Present-day English there seems to have been a partial re-establishment of the initial state due to the loss of V-to-T raising, the emergence of \emph{do}-support, and the contraction of negation.

\exg. I don't say\\
      I do-neg say\\
      (Present-day English)

Thus, the cyclic nature of the cycle can be attributed to an eventual return to original syntactic state. However, in Present-day Colloquial French there has yet to be such a change towards the original syntactic state of purely preverbal negation. Nor is any such return guaranteed to occur. It seems strange to call something a cycle if it never returns to the point of origin. A resolution to this conceptual problem lies in considering the potential causes of the cycle. The two approaches in the literature regarding the cause of the change can be summarized as \emph{push-chains} and \emph{pull-chains}.

\subsection{Pull-Chain}
In Jespersen's own words, the transition between the stages is a matter of \emph{weakening} and \emph{strengthening}.

\begin{quotation}
The history of negative expressions in various languages makes us witness the following curious fluctuation: the original negative adverb is first weakened, then found insufficient and therefore strengthened, generally through some additional word, and this in its turn may be felt as the negative proper and may then in course of time be subject to the same developments as the original word. \citep[4]{jespersen:1917} 
\end{quotation}
In the case of a pull-chain analysis, the preverbal negation has a tendency to not receive main stress and thus becomes a clitic. Given the importance of the distinction between affirmation and negation, some additional word is used ``to increase the phonetic bulk'' of the negative signal to bolster its perception \citep[14]{jespersen:1917}. That is, some new marker is \emph{pulled} into expressing negation because of the weakening of the original preverbal negator.

The prevalence of phonetic weakening suggests we should be skeptical of its role in any particular morphosyntactic change. There is ample evidence of phonetic weakening not leading to morphosyntactic change, and morphosyntactic change in the absence of any precursory phonetic weakening. More pertinent to the case at hand, \cite{posner1985} argues from Italian dialect data that apparently weak preverbal negators are not necessarily supplemented by some additional element. If phonetic weakening is not sufficient for the cycle, then this suggest that a pull-chain scenario is unlikely.

\subsection{Push-Chain}

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jespersen prefigured the other major conception of the cycle insofar as he took weakening and strengthening to be both phonetic and semantic in nature.  In the latter case, which Jespersen thought to be the more frequent, some additional word is used ``to make the negative more impressive as being more vivid or picturesque'' \citep[15]{jespersen:1917}. This intuition is exactly what more recent theories have referred to as emphasis (\citealt{detges-waltereit2002, hopper-traugottt2003, eckardt2006, kiparsky-condoravdi:2006}, \emph{inter alia}).  More precisely, the incoming form of embracing negation is emphatic in comparison to the original form of preverbal negation. 

On this second account, the increasing use of the postverbal emphatic element eventually leads to its loss of emphatic force. As \cite{kiparsky-condoravdi:2006} so eloquently note, ``to emphasize everything is to emphasize nothing.'' The directionality of the change then proceeds from the introduction of the post verbal element and its transition towards being obligatory. The new element potentially takes over the expression of negation in its own right, \emph{pushing} the original negator out. While this approach to the cycle often takes the loss of the preverbal negator as a given, it should be noted that this is most definitely not guaranteed. That is, while the postverbal element may increase in frequency and lose its emphasis, it need not necessarily come to be the sole expression of negation and push the preverbal element out. As a case in point, \cite{kiparsky-condoravdi:2006} present evidence from the history of Greek for the stability of a single preverbal negator over multiple centuries alongside 
several postverbal elements that first convey emphatic and then plain negation. This provides further evidence that a pull-chain scenario is untenable given that phonetic weakening is neither necessary nor sufficient for the cycle.

The push-chain scenario, however, offers a new perspective on the pull-chain mechanism. That is, it suggests the phonetic reduction of the preverbal element not as the cause of the change, but rather as an effect of it. The phonetic bulk of the preverbal negator may be crucial in determining if and when the expression of negation is identified elsewhere. For example, a less substantial element might not be perceived, yielding evidence that it does not express negation, whereas a more substantial element might provide  sufficient evidence for its status as the expression of negation. It is unsurprising that the relevant preverbal negator in Greek constitutes a heavy syllable, which would arguably have enough phonetic heft to be identified.

Additionally, the push-chain suggests a particular interpretation of what is being pushed. That is, the form of plain negation is being pushed out by the form of emphatic negation. The cycle can be thought of as  essentially semantico-pragmatic in nature. It stems from the loss and renewal of emphatic negation due to pragmatic pressures.  This is obviously not to say that the relevant morphosyntactic repercussions are unexpected; the surprising cross-linguistic regularity of occurrence is what prompted Jespersen's original observation. Rather, it suggests that the use of negation under pragmatic pressures can, and often does have morphosyntactic consequences. In what follows we will consider the implications of this characterization of the cycle. We start with a characterization of emphatic negation.


%\section{Emphatic Negation}

Elements recruited to induce emphasis are by and large \emph{negative polarity items}, overwhelmingly drawn from the set of \emph{minimizers} (e.g. ``not a drop'', ``not a hair'') and \emph{generalizers} (e.g. ``not ever'', ``not at all'') \citep{horn:1989}. These can be seen in the examples of the cycle in English and French above. In the case of English, ``not'' comes from Old English ``nawiht'' (\emph{literally} ``no'' + ``thing, creature, being''). In the case of French, ``pas'' comes from ``step'', and in fact still has this separate meaning in non-negative contexts. Other sources include, but are not limited to indefinite pronouns (e.g. ``no one'') and negative adverbs (e.g. ``never'') (cf. \citealt{horn:1989,vanGelderen2008negative}).

\cite{eckardt2006} draws on a variant of the analysis presented in \cite{krifka1995polarity} to give a particularly appealing account of how these NPIs are used to express emphatic negation. The basic intuition is that emphatic negation arises through the occurrence of NPIs under emphatic focus.  Theories of \emph{focus} draw on the notion of alternatives, incorporating what could have been said into the computation of focus sensitive construction \citep{rooth1992}. NPIs pick out extremal elements of the relevant set of alternatives, and emphasis indicates that this choice is in some sense surprising. This account recommends itself not only because it integrates the relevant material into the compositional machinery of the semantics, but it does so through independently motivated mechanisms. We present the two components of this account in turn, following Eckardt's exposition unless otherwise noted. We then offer a slightly simpler means of deriving the impact of emphatic negation.

The first component of Eckardt's account draws on the notion of alternatives induced by focus. In addition to the ordinary semantic interpretation, an expression $E$ also has a focus driven semantic interpretation. We can represent the first by \inter{E}$^o$ and the second by \inter{E}$^f$. The ordinary interpretation of an expression is as would be expected given the usual semantic machinery. In contrast, the focus  driven interpretation is sensitive to the presence of an abstract focus feature $f$. The focus driven interpretation of the abstract focus feature yields a set consisting of the ordinary semantic value of the expression and the set of salient alternatives in the context: $\{F_1, F_2, F_3...\}$.  Thus, the presence or absence of a focus feature gives rise to the following possibilities.

\ex. \inter{E}$^f$ $= \{\inter{E}^o\} $

\ex. \inter{E_f}$^f$ $= \{\inter{E}^o, F_1, F_2, F_3...\} $

The set of alternatives is restricted to be of the same logical type as the expression. So, for example, nouns evoke alternative entities, transitive verbs evoke binary relations between entities, and so forth. In essence, this simply captures the intuition that the realization of focus generates a set of alternatives when it occurs, but has no effect when it does not. Similarly, the abstract focus feature is, so to speak, invisible to the ordinary semantic interpretation.

Computing the meaning of a complex expression $AB$, which contains a focus marked element, is accomplished by the following  rule of evaluation, where $\infty$ indicates a suitable method of semantic composition, 

\ex. \inter{AB}$^f = \{ A_i \infty B_j | A_i \in \inter{A}^f, B_j \in \inter{B}^f \} $

When no subexpression is focus marked, this simply results in ordinary semantic composition. That is, the focus driven interpretation simply yields the normal functional application, or predicate modification, of the two subexpressions. When a subexpression is focus marked this generates a set of alternatives, which then all undergo the appropriate semantic composition.

As a simple example, consider the following sentence where $f$ indicates the abstract focus feature, which is reflected in English prosody via prominent stress.

\ex. John$_f$ knows the number.

The components of the sentence are then the following, supposing that the individuals in the context are John, Joe, and Jim.

\ex. \inter{John_f}$^f = \{ \inter{John}^o, Joe, Jim \} = \{ John, Joe, Jim \}$

\ex. \inter{\text{knows the number}}$^f = \{ \inter{\la x . know(x, \text{the number})}^o \} = \{ \la x . know(x, \text{the number}) \}$

The composition that results yields the set of alternatives of all individuals that could know the number.

\ex. \inter{\text{knows the number}}$^f$(\inter{John_f}$^f) = \{$ John knows the number, Joe knows the number, Jim knows the number $\}$


The second component of Eckardt's account is the notion of emphatic assertion. In this case, the resulting effect of emphatic assertion is taken to be akin to a tacit ``even''.  For example, consider the following sentence.

\ex. Even John$_f$ knows the number.

In addition to the assertion that John indeed knows the number, it implicates that all of the alternatives are also true, and, most importantly, that the asserted proposition is the most surprising or striking of all the alternatives.

It is this last aspect which is taken to be crucial in emphatic assertions. The effect of emphasis can be encoded as an operator, the application of which yields both the asserted content, the ordinary semantic interpretation of the sentence, along with an implicature regarding the relation between the asserted content and all its alternatives. Where $P$ is taken as some measure of expectation in a given context, the effect can be represented as the following.\footnote{This is a trivial reformulation of \cite{eckardt2006}, which is a slight departure from that of \cite{krifka1995polarity}. The latter requires that the asserted statement be more surprising than the conjunction of all other alternatives. Nothing hinges on this difference, but here we adopt the less stringent criterion.}

\ex. \textbf{emph}(S) \\ asserts: \inter{S}$^o$ \\ implicates: $\forall S' \in \inter{S}^f . P(\inter{S}^o) \leq P(\inter{S'}^o)$

That is, an emphatically asserted utterance carries with it the implicature that it is somehow surprising or unexpected in comparison to its alternatives.

With both components, we can evaluate a sentence with an NPI.

\ex. Anna did not drink [a single drop]$_f$

This sentences gives rise to the set of alternative propositions.

\ex. \inter{S}$^f$ = $\{$ `Anna did not drink a single drop', `Anna did not drink a glassful', `Anna did not drink a barrelful', `Anna did not drink a swimming pool-ful'...$\}$

Emphatically asserting this sentence leads to the implication that, of these alternatives, the proposition that is actually asserted is the most striking or unexpected.

\ex. \textbf{emph}(Anna did not drink [a single drop]$_f$) \\ asserts: Anna did not drink a single drop. \\ implicates: This is surprising or unexpected relative to what she could have drunk.

NPIs generate alternatives through focus, and emphatic focus leads to the implication that the asserted proposition is surprising or unexpected in comparison to its alternatives. Taken together, these components allow for the effects of emphatic negation to be derived pragmatically.

While these components together yield the desired effect of emphatic negation, a perhaps more parsimonious account lies in the nature of the alternatives generated by NPIs. That is, unlike the alternatives induced by focus marking of an individual, NPIs introduce alternatives that are ordered along a scale according to semantic entailment.

Scales underpin our reasoning about the relationship between ordered sets of propositions. For example, imagine a set of puzzles ordered by degree of increasing difficulty: $y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_n$. Positive and negative claims regarding an individual's ability to solve a particular puzzle allow for inferences regarding that same individual's ability to solve other puzzles. For example, consider the following.

\ex. John can solve puzzle $y_i$.

\ex. John can't solve puzzle $y_i$.

From the first, we can infer that John can solve all easier puzzles; he can solve $y_j$ for all $j \leq i$. From the second, we can infer that John cannot solve any harder puzzles; he cannot solve $y_j$ for any $j \geq i$. The latter contexts are \emph{scale-reversing} allowing inferences from low values on the scale to high values, whereas the former are \emph{scale-preserving} allowing inferences from high values on the scale to low values \citep{fauconnier1975}.

NPIs pick out the low end of a particular scale and allow us to reason about propositions higher in the scale. In contrast with ordinary negation, emphatic negation signals two things \citep{kadmon-landman1993any}. First, there is a reduced tolerance to exceptions. For example, in the case of a cook making dinner for a large group of people, the amount of potatoes that would be relevant is quite large. We can imagine the following exchange.

  \ex. \a. Will there be French fries tonight?
       \b. No, I don't have potatoes.
       \b. Maybe you have just a couple of potatoes that I could fry in my room.
       \b. Sorry, I don't have \textsc{any} potatoes.

Emphasis \emph{widens} the interpretation of potatoes from quantities relevant to a large group to quantities relevant to even a single person.
 
Second, emphasis yields a stronger statement. For example, in the case of the following threats, the latter is clearly the stronger prohibition.

  \ex. \a. If you move, I'll shoot.
       \b. If you budge an inch, I'll shoot.

It is clear that either form of the threat allows for a certain amount of pragmatic slack in interpretation: being shot for blinking would seem rather ungenerous. However, there is still a clear relationship between the two. While scratching an itch might not be advisable in either situation, it as at least less inadvisable under the former than the latter. In all those situations where the first threat would be carried out we would expect the second to be as well, but not vice versa. In this sense, emphasis \emph{strengthens} the interpretation of a given statement.

The basic intuition that connects the two effects of NPIs is that they signal something about how strictly the meaning is to be interpreted (cf. \citealt{lewis1970,landman1991}). In the examples above, this determines what it means to have potatoes or what counts as moving. We will refer to this contextually determined value as the \emph{standard of precision}. Such standards of precision stand in a particular relation to each other \citep{krifka1995polarity}. Namely, for two standards of precision, $t_i$ and $t_j$, we might say that one is stricter than the other, $t_i \prec t_j$ just in case the extensions of a given property, $\alpha$, is preserved under a loosening of the standard. 

\ex. $t_i \prec t_j$ if and only if $\alpha_j \subset \alpha_i$

This simply means that anything that holds at a stricter standard holds at a looser standard, but not necessarily vice versa. So, not having potatoes for a single person means that you still do not have enough potatoes for fifty people. But, not having potatoes for fifty people does not mean that you do not have enough for just one person. Likewise, scratching an itch might not get you shot at the looser standard, but it certainly could at the stricter one.

Intuitively, an NPI makes negation emphatic because it signals a stricter standard than might be normally expected. It suggests that the speaker has evidence for making the assertion even under some stricter standard of interpretation. While plain negation might be compatible with a wide range of standards, emphatic negation picks out a much narrower range standards. Namely, it picks out an extremely high standard, if not the highest. In this sense, emphatic negation is surprising because it is particularly informative relative to plain negation \citep{israel1998,israel2001}. This is, of course, not an immutable fact about emphatic negation. It is exactly the loss of informativity that is at the center of Jespersen's Cycle. The question is then why emphatic negation, and the information it conveys, are subject to this continual erosion. In the next section we will lay out a formal framework for exploring this question.

\chapter{Evolutionary Game Theory}

\section{Games}
\label{Games}

Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that models human decision-making when the outcomes and preferences of multiple agents are intertwined. This differs from decision theory, where a single agent is faced with bringing about his or her most preferred outcome. Rather, a game arises when the choices made by each player crucially depend on those made by others. For example, when driving a car, one prefers to be on the opposite side of the road as the next oncoming vehicle. The side of the road that best achieves the outcome of not crashing is irrelevant, but it depends on how everyone involved drives.

There are two general dimensions along which the structures of games vary. The first dimension is the order in which players make their decisions. If all players make a decision at the same time, then the game is a \emph{simultaneous} game. If players make their decisions in a particular order, then the game is a \emph{sequential} game. The second dimension is the knowledge the players have of the game. If all players know all of the

\section{Signaling}
\label{Signaling}

Here we outline the mathematical framework that will be used subsequently. First, signaling games are introduced. The relevant structures and definitions are presented along with a simple example. Second, we consider a particular solution concept for the behavior of a population and relate it to the previously given example. This allows us to determine the existence and characteristics of equilibria. Finally, we specify a game dynamics which determines how a population of agents changes over time. We note its relation to the solution concept, and where it adds to the model.

It should be noted that there are multiple traditions that have contributed to the development of signaling games. In the Economic tradition the work of \cite{harsanyi:1967,harsanyi:1968a,harsanyi:1968b} on games of incomplete information and Spence's \citeyearpar{spence:1973} model of job signaling have been central. In the Philosophical tradition, the work of \cite{lewis:1969} has been the most influential. His response to the Quinean skepticism that meaning could arise by convention has had the most direct impact on Linguistics. This account, however, rests on the assumption that speakers and hearers have perfectly-aligned interests.  This assumption will figure in the exposition of this section, mostly for the simplicity it affords us in the examples. In the next section we turn towards the consequences of loosening it.

Signaling games offer an intuitive model of communication between agents.  A signaling game consists of two players, a sender and a receiver. The sender has some private piece of information, $t \in T$, drawn according to some commonly known probability distribution, $\delta$. The piece  of information can be thought of as some fact about the state of the world. For example, we might think of it as information that the sender wants to convey to the receiver. The sender chooses a message, $m \in M$, to send to the receiver.   The receiver does not know what state of the world actually holds and must choose an action, $a \in A$, as an interpretation of the message sent. That is, the receiver is faced with the problem of inferring the state of the sender given the message.

The outcome of the game is determined by the state of the sender, the message sent, and the action taken by the receiver. The sender and the receiver have preferences over these outcomes, which are given by utility functions, $U_S$ and $U_R$ respectively, which map outcomes to real numbers:\footnote{It should be noted that utilities are only important insofar as they represent an ordinal ranking over outcomes, and should only be interpreted as such. In other words, there is nothing particularly special about $0$ and $1$ as opposed to say $3.277$ and $110$ other than the fact that in both cases the first is less than the second. Generally speaking, where possible, it is best to keep things algebraic to avoid imputing anything more meaningful.} $U_S,U_R:T \times M \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

As a simple example of a signaling game, consider the case where there are two states, two messages, and two actions: $T = \{t_1, t_2 \}$, $M = \{m_1, m_2 \}$, and $A = \{a_1, a_2 \}$. We can represent the structure of the game in \emph{extensive form} as in Figure \ref{SG1}. The uppermost node, labeled $\delta$, determines the likelihood of either of the two states occurring. The lines from the uppermost node represent one state or the other obtaining. The nodes labeled $S$ indicate the points in the game where the sender makes a decision regarding which message to send. The nodes labeled $R$ indicate the points where the receiver must make a decision regarding how to interpret the message. The dashed lines between receiver nodes indicates that the receiver is uncertain as to which state holds after hearing a given message. The nodes at the bottom represent the outcome and the players' preferences, as determined by the utility functions.

\label{SG1}
\end{figure}
As alluded to above, with the exception of the topmost node and the leaves, all other nodes are \emph{decision nodes}. That is, they represent those points in the game where a particular player must make a decision. An \emph{information set} consists of a set of decision nodes for a given player, which that player cannot distinguish. For example, the receiver is in an information set after hearing $m_2$. She is not sure whether she is in the node beneath state $t_1$ or $t_2$ and she must choose between $a_2$ and $a_2$. She is likewise uncertain after receiving message $m_2$. Again, her inability to distinguish the two states is indicated by a dashed line. An information set can also consist of a single decision node. For example, the sender is never uncertain about the state he is in. Thus the information sets for the sender only ever consist of a single node. 

For each player, a \emph{strategy} specifies which action to take at all \emph{information sets} for a player.\footnote{For simplicity, we only consider \emph{pure} sender (receiver) strategies, functions from states to messages (messages to actions). \emph{Mixed} strategies are a straightforward generalization. A mixed sender strategy specifies a probability distribution over pure sender strategies, $\sigma = p_1 s_1 + ... + p_k s_k$, where $\sum_i p_i = 1$. Similarly, a mixed receiver strategy specifies a probability distribution over pure receiver strategies, $\rho = q_1 r_1 + ... + q_k r_k$.} We will refer to the set of all such sender strategies as $S : [T \rightarrow M ]$, and the set of all such receiver as $R : [M \rightarrow A]$. The set of possible combinations of sender and receiver strategies constitute \emph{strategy profiles}. That is, a sender strategy in the set of possible sender strategies, $s \in S$, and a receiver strategy in the set of all possible receiver strategies, $r  \in R$, yield 
a strategy profile $\langle s,r \rangle$.

Each strategy profile determines the outcome of the game. Crucially, each player's utility function depends on the state of the sender and the action taken by the receiver. That is, their respective utilities are a function of state and action. As an example, consider the case where both sender and receiver prefer successful communication. Then they both receive their preferred payoffs if there is some correspondence between the sender's state and the receiver's action. For example, in Figure \ref{SG1} both sender and receiver prefer the state and action to be the same in the following sense.

\begin{equation}
 U_{S}(t_i, a_k) = U_{R}(t_i, a_k) =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		1  & \mbox{if } i = k \\
		0 & \mbox{else}
	\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
Note that this reflects the assumption that both sender and receiver have the same preference over outcomes.

Given that the different states occur with certain probabilities, and we are interested in how particular strategies do on average, we consider the \emph{expected utility} for a given strategy profile. This is simply the expected value of the utility functions given the two strategies, which can be given in the case of a discrete state space as in our example above.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 E[U_{S}(s,r)] &= \sum_{t} \delta (t) \cdot U_S(t, r(s(t)))\\
 E[U_{R}(s,r)] &= \sum_{t} \delta (t) \cdot U_R(t, r(s(t)))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For each possible state the sender and receiver strategies determine an outcome. $s(t)$ is the message the sender will employ and $r(s(t))$ is the action the receiver will take given that message. The expected utility is the sum of these outcomes weighted by the probability of the state that yields them. With these components in place we can now turn to defining the notion of equilibrium and its role in the framework.


\section{Equilibria}

A game by itself does not constitute a model in the technical sense. It is a mathematical structure that describes the players preferences and actions, but it does not predict their behavior \emph{per se}. To do so it must be supplemented with a \emph{solution concept} that predicts the conditions under which particular outcomes will obtain. Perhaps the most widely used solution concept is that of a \emph{Nash equilibrium}, which specifies when players have an incentive to unilaterally deviate from a given strategy profile.

\begin{definition}
 A strategy profile $\langle s^*, r^*\rangle$ is a \emph{Nash equilibrium}
if and only if:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item For all $s \in S$, such that $s \neq s^*$, $E[U_S(s^*,r^*)] \geq
E[U_S(s,r^*)]$
  \item For all $r \in R$, such that $r \neq r^*$, $E[U_R(s^*,r^*)] \geq
E[U_S(s^*,r)]$
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The two conditions simply state that neither the sender nor the receiver can do better by individually changing his or her strategy from the equilibrium profile.  The sender's strategy is his \emph{best response} to the receiver's strategy, and the receiver's strategy is likewise her best response to the sender's strategy. Note that these best responses need not be unique to consitute an equilibrium. This follows from the fact that the inequalities in the definiton are not strict. We can, however, impose uniqueness in these best responses by requiring that the inequalities in the definition be strict. A \emph{strict Nash equilibrium} results, meaning that players can only ever do worse if they unilaterally deviate from the equilibrium. Strict Nash equilibria are thus a proper subset of Nash equilibria.

Since we are interested not just in the behavior of a given sender and receiver, but rather the aggregate behavior of a population, we want a broader notion of equilibrium. In particular, we might ask whether a given population is susceptible to change. When considering \emph{asymmetric games}, such as signaling games, where players have different roles, we are actually concerned with two populations: a sender population and a receiver population. To determine the stability of the two populations we can consider a \emph{symmetrized} version of the signaling game, where individuals act as both sender and receiver. A strategy in the symmetrized game is thus a strategy profile of the asymmetric game.

In the case of the static problem, stability is determined with reference to static solution concepts. At the population level, the most relevant concept is that of an \emph{evolutionarily stable strategy} \citep{maynard-smith-price:1973,maynard-smith1982}. Where $U(S^*, S)$ is the payoff to an agent using strategy $S^*$ against an agent using strategy $S$, we have the following definition.

\begin{definition}
 A strategy $S^*$ is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) if and only if, for all alternate strategies $S$:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $U(S^*, S^*) \geq U(S,S^*)$
 \item If $U(S^*, S^*) = U(S,S^*)$ then $U(S^*, S) > U(S,S)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

A straightforward interpretation of this definition can be had by imagining a population composed entirely of individuals playing $S^*$. Suppose some small proportion, $1 \gg \epsilon > 0$, of individuals playing the alternative $S$ is introduced into the population. The following inequality holds if and only if $S^*$ is an ESS.

\begin{equation}
\label{ESSlinear}
(1-\epsilon )U(S^*,S^*) + \epsilon U(S^*,S)  > (1-\epsilon)U(S,S^*) + \epsilon U(S,S)
\end{equation}
In other words, for any sufficiently small influx of the alternate strategy, the expected payoff of the incumbent strategy in the resulting population is strictly greater than that of the alternate. Intuitively, $S^*$ is stable because selection will carry the population back to playing $S^*$.

It is important to note, despite the dynamic terminology, an ESS is still an essentially static concept. We may naturally expect some form of selection to eliminate strategies with lower expected payoffs and carry the population back to playing $S^*$. But, we have not been explicit about the game dynamic that does the carrying. \cite{taylor-jonker:1978} introduced the replicator dynamic to explicitly address the dynamical aspects of evolutionarily stable strategies. Thus there is a fundamental connection between the two. This connection does not necessarily extend to other game dynamics though. There is no guarantee that solutions to the static problem will tell us anything about solutions to the dynamic problem for game dynamics in general. What we need is a set of criteria that can be applied to any game dynamic.


For a population playing the symmetrized game, change depends on whether a given strategy is an \emph{evolutionarily stable strategy} \citep{maynard-smith-price:1973}. Loosely speaking, a strategy is evolutionarily stable if it is resistant to invasion by alternate strategies. That is, when an entire population plays the incumbent strategy the incumbents do at least as well as a mutant. If the mutant does as well, then the incumbent strategy should do better than a mutant in an all-mutant population.  In this case a mutation can be interpreted either in the biological sense or in terms of cultural innovation, such as the introduction of new linguistic signal. The relevant criterion for stability is actually quite simple. For symmetrized asymmetric games, a strategy profile is  evolutionarily stable if and only if it constitutes a strict Nash equilibrium in the original asymmetric game \citep{selten:1980}. That is, mutant senders and receivers only ever do worse than the incumbent strategies. 

For the Lewisian signaling game described above, where states are equiprobable, $\delta(t_1) = \delta(t_2) = \frac{1}{2}$, the only strict equilibria are those where senders employ different signals for each state, and receivers map those messages to the appropriate actions. In other words, the senders \emph{separate} themselves and receivers respond accordingly. These equilibria are referred to as \emph{separating equilibria}. There are also equilibria where senders \emph{pool} themselves together and use only a single message. Receivers are indifferent between actions; they receive the same expected utility for taking either action. These are referred to as \emph{pooling equilibria}. Note that these pooling equilibria are not strict insofar as any action taken by the receiver yields the same expected utility. Thus, in the case of perfectly-aligned interests, separating equilibria are the only evolutionarily stable strategies.


\section{Dynamics}

While the term suggests a dynamic interpretation, equilibria, including evolutionarily stable strategies are essentially a static solution concept. They tell us whether a strategy is resistant to invasion or innovation, but tell us nothing about where the populations go to from there. To understand how a population changes over time, a particular \emph{game dynamics} must be supplied. These provide a  description for how a population, or populations, changes from one point in time to the next. Here we use the replicator equations as our game dynamic.

Originally developed as a model of biological replication under selection \citep{taylor-jonker:1978}, the replicator equations are appealing for a number of reasons. First, they are the most extensively studied dynamics and share a number of mathematical properties with a larger set of game dynamics \citep{hofbauer-sigmund:1998}.  This makes establishing results and connecting them to a broader class of dynamics more straightforward. Second, they have a natural interpretation as a form of learning or cultural imitation \citep{fudenberg-levine:1998} and have found broad application in modeling economic \citep{samuelson:1997, cressman:2003} and social behavior \citep{skyrms:1996,skyrms:2004,skyrms:2010}.

The intuition behind the replicator equations is that  more successful strategies increase in frequency. In particular, strategies that are more successful than the population average increase in share of the population. For example, let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ represent the composition of a sender and receiver population respectively. $x_i$ represents the proportion of senders who use strategy $s_i$, and $y_i$ represents the proportion of receivers who use strategy $r_i$. The change of $x_i$ in the population, $\dot{x}_i$, can be given as the following where $f_i(\mathbf{y})$ is the expected utility of $s_i$ given the receiver population, and the average sender expected utility is given as $f(\mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i} x_if_i(\mathbf{y})$.

\begin{equation}
     \dot{x}_i = x_i(f_i(\mathbf{y}) - f(\mathbf{y}))
\end{equation}
The parallel formulation for receiver strategies is then the following, $g_i(\mathbf{x})$ is the expected utility of $r_i$ and $g(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i} y_ig_i(\mathbf{x})$.

\begin{equation}
     \dot{y}_i = y_i(g_i(\mathbf{x}) - g(\mathbf{x}))
\end{equation}

Sender and receiver strategies that do better than average have a positive derivative and thus increase. Sender and receiver strategies that do worse than average have a negative derivative and thus decrease. The \emph{rest points} of the dynamics are compositions of the respective populations that do not change from one point in time to the next. Note that by definition Nash equilibria constitute rest points of the dynamics. Neither senders nor receivers have an incentive to deviate from their respective equilibrium strategies. Thus, the average expected utility is identical to the expected utilities of the equilibrium strategies, and the composition of the population does not change.

While we noted that the pooling equilibria in the game described above are not evolutionarily stable strategies, the game dynamics yield further information. That is, the pooling equilibria are saddle points of the dynamics. Almost any small deviation from them leads the population to converge to one of the separating equilibria, which are evolutionarily stable strategies. Crucially, any small difference in the response of receivers to the different signals allows for a kind of tie-breaking. Senders respond to the receivers differentiation by separating, and the population as a whole moves towards one of the separating equilibria.

A bit more formally, for a state space $\mathbf{x} = \{x_1, x_2,...,x_n \}$, a solution trajectory through the state space over time $\mathbf{x(t)}$ is governed by the differential equations defined by the game dynamics $\mathbf{\dot{x}} = \{\dot{x}_1, \dot{x}_2,...,\dot{x}_n \}$. The rest points of the system are states where the differential equations vanish; any trajectory starting at a rest point will remain there at rest. For a rest point $\mathbf{x^*}$, if $\mathbf{x(0)} = \mathbf{x^*}$ then $\mathbf{x(t)} = \mathbf{x^*}$ for all times $t > 0$, since $\mathbf{\dot{x}} = 0$. We are, however, interested in the relation between the entire state space and these rest points. The criteria we listed above, then, require the following definition.

\begin{definition}
 A rest point $\mathbf{x^*}$ is asymptotically stable if and only if:
\begin{enumerate}
     \item For every neighborhood $V$ of $\mathbf{x^*}$, there is a neighborhood $V'$ of $\mathbf{x^*}$ such that if $\mathbf{x(0)} \in V'$ then $\mathbf{x(t)} \in V$ for all $t > 0$.
     \item For some $\epsilon > 0$, for all $\mathbf{x(0)}$ such that $\epsilon > \Vert \mathbf{x(0)} - \mathbf{x^*} \Vert$, then $\mathbf{x(t)} \rightarrow \mathbf{x^*}$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
The first condition requires that all trajectories that start near a rest point stay near it. Small perturbations from the rest point do not lead the system away from the rest point, but rather to some nearby state. If only this first condition is met, then the rest point is \emph{weakly} or \emph{Liapunov} stable. The second condition requires that all points near to the rest point converge to it in the limit. The set of all states that converge to a rest point constitute its basin of attraction. If both these conditions are met, then the rest point is \emph{strongly} or \emph{asymptotically} stable. If neither of these conditions is met, then the rest point is \emph{unstable}.

Now that we have specified the relevant rest points, we want to know whether they are stable. That is, we want to know if the game dynamic will carry the population towards the rest points or away from them. To do so, we evaluate the derivative of the dynamic at the rest points. If it is positive, then the rest point is unstable. If it is negative, then the rest point is asymptotically stable.\footnote{This is just the one-dimensional version of evaluating the eigenvalues of a linearized system around a rest point  in higher dimensions; see \cite{hirsch-smale1974} for details.} The intuitive notion here is that rest points with a positive derivative correspond to ``hills" and rest points with a negative derivative correspond to ``valleys".

An object may be at rest at the top of a hill. But, if we give it a small push, it will roll down one of the sides of the hill. An object in a valley between two hills will also be at rest. And, if we give it a small push, it  will return to this position. All we are doing when we evaluate the derivative is finding out whether the population will be carried away from the rest point or back to it. We are finding out whether it is a ``hill'' or a ``valley'' under the game dynamic.


% The structure of the signaling game along with the game dynamics specify the trajectory of the population over time through a large dimensional space. By definition, evolutionarily stable strategies constitute rest points of the replicator equations. But, in those cases where no evolutionarily stable strategies exist, the game dynamics specify the long-term behavior of the population by allowing us to characterize the stability properties of existing rest points.

We are now in a position to bring the formal framework developed in Section \ref{Signaling} to bear on the use of emphatic negation and its role in Jespersen's Cycle. We begin by first mapping the components discussed in Section \ref{Background} onto the structure of a signaling game. The possibility of different preferences for speakers and hearers is incorporated into the structure of the model. We determine the existence of evolutionarily stable strategies and note the transfer of information as the interests of speaker and hearer diverge. As the preferences of speakers and hearers diverge signaling becomes less informative. For sufficiently low differences, signaling remains informative, but beyond a certain point signaling collapses into uninformative pooling. We then consider the impact of introducing new signals, which lead to a kind of push-chain where the least informative signal is lost. Throughout, we discuss the implications of the model for Jespersen's Cycle.

\section{Signaling Game}

To begin, we must first consider how signaling games capture the use of negation. As we noted above, the difference between plain and emphatic negation is captured by the standard of precision applied. The speaker has knowledge about some state of the world which renders a particular negative expression acceptable on some standards, but not necessarily on others. Thus, there exists a continuum of states for the speaker, which we will take to be the interval $T = [0,1]$. The lowest possible value on such an interval corresponds to the weakest possible standard of precision that would still render the negative expression acceptable.\footnote{Here we leave out the possibility of the use of a given expression in the absence of any standard of precision being met. That is, we leave out cases of outright lying. Such cases are particularly interesting, but we leave them as a consideration for future study.} The highest possible value on the interval is then the strictest possible standard of 
interpretation available. 

Given that the speaker has observed some state of affairs, $t \in T$, he must choose a message, $m \in M$, to send to the hearer. Let $\mathcal{P}_n(T)= 0 < ... < t_{n-1} < ... < 1$ be a partition of the state space into $n$ subintervals.  A speaker's strategy is then a function from a partition of the type space to messages, $S : [\mathcal{P}_n(T) \rightarrow M]$. Intuitively, this is simply a way of carving up the state space into discrete regions and using those regions to determine which signal to send. For example, the trivial partition, $\mathcal{P}_1(T)$, occurs when the sender pools all types together and uses only a single message. In what follows we will largely be concerned with partitions of at least size two $\mathcal{P}_2(T)$. For example, consider the case of two messages, consisting of just a plain and an emphatic form. Letting $\mathcal{P}_2(T) = 0 < t_1 < 1$, a possible sender strategy is then  $s(t) = m_1$ for $t \in (0,t_1)$, and $s(t) = m_2$ for $t \in (t_1,1)$. That is, the sender uses 
$m_1$ for all types in the first subinterval, and $m_2$ for the second subinterval. Intuitively, we would refer to $m_1$ as the plain form of negation and $m_2$ as the emphatic.

Once the speaker has sent a message, the hearer is faced with the problem of how to interpret it. Given that the hearer cannot read the speaker's mind, she must infer the state of affairs that prompted the use of a particular form. That is, given the information conveyed by the signal, she must do her best to determine the standard of precision that warrants the speakers assertion. We will take the space of possible interpretations available to the hearer to be equivalent to the type space of the speaker, $A = [0,1]$. This representation captures the fact that the interpretation of expressions is not an all or nothing affair, but rather a matter of degrees.  A hearer's strategy is then a mapping from messages to interpretations, as above, $R : [M \rightarrow A]$.

With the definition of the strategies available to speakers and hearers, we can ask what kinds of preferences both might have over the correspondence between actual and inferred standards. It is uncontroversial that hearers are in the business of doing their best to accurately infer the actual state of affairs that prompted the signal. That is, hearers prefer their interpretation to be as close as possible to the standard of precision that the speaker actually has evidence for.  If it were otherwise, the existence of language would be truly puzzling from an evolutionary perspective; the gullible are not long for the tooth and claw world. So, if hearers are interested in the accurate transmission of information, then any misalignment must come from speakers' preferences. 

From the perspective of the speaker, we can adduce at least two related reasons why speakers might prefer overestimation. The first imputes a kind of categorical bias on the part of speakers, whereas the second relaxes this bias towards reasonability. We address them each in turn. First, we consider what the goals of communication are. Arguably, our chief goal in uttering a given expression is to affect some response in our interlocutors. In the case of a declaration we might think of this in terms of how convinced the hearer is after hearing an utterance. Or, in the terms we have developed thus far, we want the hearer to infer a particular standard of precision. We could take this preference as categorical. Namely, that regardless of the actual standard of precision, speakers want hearers to infer the absolute highest standard of precision possible. Given such a preference and a choice between signals that hearers respond to differentially, speakers will always choose the form that elicits the higher 
standard.  Speakers are, so to speak, on the lookout for the form that gives them the most bang for their breath. It should be noted that this bias is stipulative only insofar as it arises from the fundamental way we use words to do things.

Second, while this bias may naturally exist, it need not be categorical. Rather, speakers may simply prefer that hearers infer a standard of precision that is at least is strict as their own. This can be taken as a natural corollary of the inferential nature of communication. Hearers cannot read minds, and thus they must make some inference about the actual standard of precision. Speakers have only an indirect influence on this process of inference. Thus, they may wish to hedge their bets in a particular direction. Namely, they may want the inferred standard to be at least as strict as there own because it ensures that their own beliefs stand in a particular relation to hearers'. That is, the hearer's beliefs probabilistically entail those of the speaker.

The impact of this relationship is particularly clear with regard to perlocutionary concerns. For example, imagine the case where the issuer of one of the following threats has absolutely no desire to follow through on it.

  \ex. \a. If you move, I'll shoot.
       \b. If you budge an inch, I'll shoot.

By using the stronger threat, leading the hearer to infer a stricter standard than actually holds, the speaker has a better chance of not being forced to follow through on it. That is, the hearer will restrict his actions to those that do not constitute movement at the stricter standard, thus guaranteeing that they will not at the weaker actual standard. 

The same concerns hold in far more magnanimous circumstances. For example, in the case of offering a friend genuine advice on dining options, one might deem a mediocre restaurant one of the following.

 \ex. \a. Not good.
      \b. Not worth a cent!

While clearly hyperbole, the latter, much like the strong threat, offers a means for speakers to guide a friend to a good meal. In both cases, when hearers underestimate the standard of precision, the speaker runs the risk of not achieving his goals with resulting dire or not so delicious consequences. In contrast, these goals are guaranteed when hearers overestimate the standard of precision.

We can encode this slight bias in the utility functions of senders and receivers. As a means of parameterizing this possibility, we define the sender and receiver utility functions as a pair of quadratic functions, as in \cite{crawford-sobel:1982}, where $b \in [0,1]$ reflects the bias of the sender.\footnote{This bias need not be constant. For example, we might suppose that the bias is uniformly distributed over the interval $(t,t+b)$. This would capture the intuition that some of the time a speaker prefers overestimation of the standard, but not others. All of the following result hold for this more general case. As a preview, the only change below is that partial pooling equilibrium is defined at $t^* = \frac{1}{2} - 3b$ }

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     U_S(t, a) &= -(a - t - b)^2\\
  	 U_R(t, a) &= -(a - t)^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
These utility functions reflect two intuitions. First, for a given type of sender, there is an action that maximizes the receiver's payoff. That is, the receiver does best by taking the action that is closest to the sender's type. Second, for a sender with a particular type, the action that maximizes the sender's payoff is offset by some bias, $b$. That is, the sender prefers the receiver to take the action she thinks appropriate for some higher type. In this case, $b$ represents the degree to which the sender wishes to exaggerate his type, if the receiver believes such exaggerations. When $b=0$ the interests of senders and receivers are completely aligned, but as $b$ grows, they diverge. This parallels the intuition that hearers are trying to infer the standard of precision for a given assertion, and prefer this to be as accurate as possible. It also reflects the fact that speakers have a slight preference for hearers to overestimate the standard of precision.

The impact of the sender's bias can be visualized as in Figure \ref{receiver_payoff}. For a sender with information $t=0$, the receiver would do best to take the action that accurately picks out the sender's state. In contrast, the sender's most preferred action is offset by the amount of bias. In the case where $b=\frac{1}{2}$, then the sender prefers the speaker to take an action higher than the receiver would prefer. This mismatch is only exacerbated as the amount of bias increases, as can be seen for the case where $b=1$. Visually speaking, as the bias increases, the utility functions of the sender and the receiver move away from each other.

\section{Equilibria}

For a given pair of sender and receiver strategies we can calculate the expected utility. In what follows we will assume that types are uniformly distributed over the interval, which yields the following expected utilities. Note that these are exactly parallel to expected utilities in a discrete state space presented above.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     E[U_S(s, r)] &= \int_T -(r(s(t)) - t - b)^2 dt\\
      E[U_R(s, r)] &= \int_T -(r(s(t)) - t)^2 dt
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Now, we want to determine the conditions for equilibria. By doing so, we are determining what kinds of behavior we would expect on the part of speakers and hearers given the speaker's bias. That is, we want know how speakers will use different forms to signal standards of precision and how hearers will interpret them. The existence of different equilibria and their relative stability are crucial to the dynamics of Jespersen's Cycle.

Consider the potential equilibrium strategy profile $\langle s^*, r^* \rangle$. Let $s^*$ induce a partition of type $\mathcal{P}_2(T)$, where $t^*$ is the relevant threshold that distinguishes the two messages. Let $s^*(t) = m_1$ for $t \in (0,t^*)$ and $s^*(t) = m_2$ for $t \in (t^*,1)$. Let $r^*(m_1) = a_1^*$ and $r^*(m_2) = a_2^*$. In words, the sender splits the type space in two and sends a unique message for each subinterval. These are the plain and the emphatic forms of negation, respectively. The receiver responds to these messages with a particular action.  These are the inferred standards of precision in response to the different forms.

The strategy profile is an equilibrium if the relevant strategies are joint best responses. We can determine this by simply taking the partial derivative of the relevant utility functions with regard to the relevant variables. For the receiver, this can be determined by considering what actions are the best response to the senders partition. This simply tells us how the receiver's inference depends on the sender's use of the different forms.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial a_1^*}E[U_R(s, r)] = \frac{\partial}{\partial a_2^*}E[U_R(s, r)] = 0
\end{equation}
These values are uniquely satisfied when the following hold.

\begin{equation}
     \begin{split}
	  a_1^* &= \frac{t^*}{2}\\
	  a_2^* &= \frac{1 + t^*}{2}
     \end{split}
\end{equation}
Intuitively, this means that however the speaker splits up the standards of precision, the receiver should respond to the emphatic form by inferring a higher standard of precision and the plain form with a lower standard of precision. The exact placement of these responses is determined by how the sender uses the signals. Namely, the hearer should infer the average standard of precision used for each of the two forms.

For the sender, we can proceed in a similar fashion determining when the following holds.
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial}{\partial t^*}E[U_S(s, r)] = 0
\end{equation}
This equation is satisfied when one of the following holds.

\begin{equation}
     \begin{split}
 	t^* &= 0\\
	t^* &= \frac{3}{4}(a_1^* + a_2^*) - \frac{3}{2}b - \frac{1}{4}\\
	t^* &= 1
     \end{split}
\end{equation}

These constraints together give rise to three distinct systems of equation. Solving each for $t^*$, we find the following equilibrium solutions in terms of the bias of the sender.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     t^* &= 0\\
     t^* &= \frac{1}{2} - 6b\\
     t^* &= 1
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Both the first and the last of these equilibria are pooling equilibria. That is, senders only ever use a single signal. In response to this, receivers take the action that maximizes their expected utility given the prior probability distribution over types. That is, they guess the expected value of the type space. They simply infer the average standard of precision.

In contrast, the middle equilibrium constitutes a partially separating equilibrium. It is only partially separating because the state space is infinite, while the message space is not. This means that every type cannot be fully revealed, but that some information is transferred. The amount of information transferred and the distinction between the partially separating and pooling equilibria can be characterized in information-theoretic terms \citep{shannon:1948}. In particular, we can think of the amount of information conveyed by a particular signal at equilibrium according to the \emph{Kullback-Leibler Divergence} \citeyearpar{kullback-leibler1951divergence}.

\begin{equation}
     D_{KL}(P || Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} log\left( \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}  \right)p(x) dx
\end{equation}
This serves as a measure for how much change is induced in the receiver by a particular message. That is, in our case $q(x)$ corresponds to the prior probability distribution over types, and $p(x)$ corresponds to the probability of a sender being of a particular type given the message. The more the message shifts the probability from the prior, the more information it conveys. And, the less a message shifts the probability from the prior, the less information it conveys. 

For example, taking either of the pooling equilibria as an example.  If senders use the same signal regardless of state, then the conditional probability is the same as the prior probability. This means that there is absolutely no change from the prior probability, and hence zero information is transmitted via the signal. In contrast, for any partially separating equilibrium, a particular message induces a shift from the prior probability, and thus conveys some information. We should note that the amount of information conveyed regarding the standard of precision is distinct from the propositional content of a given utterance. For example, in the case where speakers use only a single form of negation for all standards of precision, the hearer will have no information in addition to and exceeding the prior probability. However, she will know the propositional content of the utterance. In other words, she will know \emph{that} negation was used, but not \emph{how} it was used.


Information is transferred at equilibrium only if the partially separating equilibrium exists. This is the case when the sender's bias is sufficiently low. Namely, only if $b < \frac{1}{12}$. If the bias is too large, then the partially separating equilibrium collapses into the lower pooling equilibrium.  However, a partially separating equilibrium, if it exists, is the only evolutionarily stable strategy profile. To see this note that in any pooling equilibrium receivers can respond to an unused message with any action whatsoever without affecting their expected utility. This means that pooling equilibria are not strict Nash equilibria and are thus not stable to invasion or innovation. 

% For example, suppose that receivers responded to an unused message with an action $a > \frac{1}{2}$. All senders would then do better to use that previously unused message in a particular set of states, $(\frac{1}{2}(a + \frac{1}{2}), 1]$. In turn, receivers woul
% 
%  have an incentive to adjust their responses to the two messages. In turn, senders have an incentive to adjust to this adjustment, and so forth. This process of mutual adjustment ends at the evolutionarily stable partially separating equilibrium.

We have established an upper limit on the amount of bias that allows for two signals to be used informatively. If this bias is exceeded, then signaling collapses. A single message is used, but carries no information. In fact, for a given number of signals, $n$, there exists some level of bias, $b_n$, that allows for their informative use in a partially separating equilibrium based on a sender's partition of the type space, $\mathcal{P}_n$ \citep{crawford-sobel:1982}. As the number of signals increase, the amount of bias must decrease to allow for informativity, thus $b_2 > b_3 > ... > b_n$. Intuitively, as the preferences of senders and receivers approach each other a finer and finer partition of the space is possible.

\section{Dynamics}

So, what does this mean for Jespersen's cycle? Intuitively, the pragmatics of emphasis suggest that the population originally starts at a point where one form is used with a  very high standard of precision and another is used for all other standards. That is, emphatic negation is distinguished from plain negation in its contexts of use. We can determine what will happen to these two signals over time. Intuitively, under the game dynamics, the signals will converge to their equilibrium use.

Under the game dynamics, for any amount of bias, no matter how slight, the emphatic form will spread to lower and lower standards of precision until it reaches its equilibrium use. The amount of bias determines where this process stops. That is, if a partially separating equilibrium exists, then the emphatic form will expand to encompass all standards of the upper part of the partition. In other words, the emphatic will be \emph{attenuated}, but still carry some information.  If no separation is possible, the emphatic form will spread across all standards. In other words, the emphatic will be entirely \emph{bleached} of its emphasis. Note that in both cases the process can be characterized in information-theoretic terms. That is, as the emphatic form spreads to more and more standard it conveys less and less information. 

The stable coexistence of plain and emphatic negation for long periods of time suggest that the bias is sufficiently small to allow for at least two forms. This, however, raises the question of what destabilizes the system. The system must be disturbed by a push chain, whereby the signal used for the lowest subinterval is lost. More generally, imagine a system with bias $b_n$ at equilibrium. Now, suppose that a new signal is introduced, so that there are now $n+1$ signals. Clearly, the system is not stable. However, it will be carried back to some equilibrium by the game dynamics. The resultant equilibrium depends on the character of the signal that is introduced. Let $a'$ be the response of receivers to the new signal $m'$. All messages that receive a lower response than $a'$ will be pushed down, the lowest of these being pushed out of use completely.  In the case of Jespersen's Cycle, new signals enter with a high $a'$, and thus displace everything below. That is, they are emphatic and lead hearers to 
infer a high standard of precision. This means that all other forms lower in the scale will be pushed down and the lowest will be pushed out of existence, exactly like what we see in the actual instantiation of the cycle.


The motivation of this project stems from particular hypotheses about the conditioning factors of negation in Jespersen's Cycle \citeyearpar{jespersen:1917}, which can be characterized by the transition from pre-verbal to embracing to post-verbal negation: \textsc{\color{red} neg V} $\rightarrow$ \textsc{\color{blue} neg V neg} $\rightarrow$ \textsc{\color{green} V neg}. In particular, \cite{hansen2009, hansen-visconti2009,hansen-visconti2012} have used historical corpora of French and Italian to show that the embracing form (\textsc{\color{blue} neg V neg}) is sensitive to the discourse status of the proposition being negated. Namely, the embracing form is restricted to instances where the proposition being negated is either \textsc{discourse old} or \textsc{inferrable}.

\cite{schwenter2005,schwenter2006} uses synchronic data from Brazilian Portuguese to demonstrate the sensitivity of negation to these distinctions. Consider the following scenario. Suppose that a husband and wife expect a plumber to come fix their leaky faucet while they are at work during the day. The husband arrives home before his wife to find a still leaky faucet. The wife arrives home shortly and the first thing her husband says is the following.

\exg.  O bombeiro \textsc{\color{red} n{\~a}o} \textsc{\color{red} Veio}.\\
         The plumber neg came\\
         ``The plumber didn't come."\\

\exg. \#O bombeiro \textsc{\color{blue}n{\~a}o} \textsc{\color{blue}Veio} \textsc{\color{blue}n{\~a}o}.\\
	The plumber neg came neg\\
	``The plumber didn't come."\\

The reason that the embracing form is odd is that it comes out of the blue, so to speak. That is, the proposition ``The plumber came.'' is entirely \textsc{discourse new}. Even if the husband has some expectation that his wife has been thinking about whether or not the plumber came, the proposition has not been introduced into the \emph{discourse} yet. The embracing form cannot be used to negate \textsc{discourse new} propositions.

However, how the proposition can be introduced into the discourse in several ways, both explicitly and implicitly. For example, if the wife walks in the door and says the following.

\exg.  O bombeiro veio hoje?\\
       The plumber came today\\
         ``Did the plumber come today?"\\

Asking the question has explicitly introduced the proposition into the discourse, making either form appropriate in the husband's response. In fact, the wife need not even explicitly ask the question. For example, if she arrives home and points quizzically at sink, then the embracing form is fine. This is because the proposition can be inferred from the discourse.

Schwenter shows that even finer distinctions can be made in the sensitivity of different forms of negation to discourse context. For example, consider the following scenario. Suppose that two colleagues meet in a departmental hallway in the afternoon after a scheduled talk, and one asks the other the following question.

\exg. Voc{\^e} gostou da palestra da Maria?\\
	 you liked the talk of Maria\\
	 ``Did you like Maria's talk?"

\exg. \textsc{\color{blue}N{\~a}o} \textsc{\color{blue}Fui} \textsc{\color{blue}n{\~a}o}.\\
	 neg went neg\\
	 ``I didn't go."\\

\exg. \#\textsc{\color{green}Fui} \textsc{\color{green}n{\~a}o}.\\
	  went neg\\
	 ``I didn't go."\\

The reason that the post-verbal form is odd is that the proposition being negated ``I went (to Maria's talk).'' is only indirectly connected to the discourse. That is, liking a talk presumably requires having attended it, so the proposition is only \textsc{inferrable} from the discourse. The post-verbal form cannot be used where the proposition is discourse new or inferrable. This is made clear by altering the form of the response to the question of liking the talk.

\exg. \textsc{\color{blue}N{\~a}o} \textsc{\color{blue}Gostei} \textsc{\color{blue}n{\~a}o}.\\
	 neg liked neg\\
	 ``I didn't like it."\\

\exg. \textsc{\color{green}Gostei} \textsc{\color{green}n{\~a}o}.\\
	  liked neg\\
	 ``I didn't like it."\\

In this case the post-verbal form is acceptable because the proposition ``I liked Maria's talk.'' has been introduced into the discourse by the original question. The conditions and restrictions on different forms can be summarized as in Table \ref{schwenter}. The pre-verbal form is acceptable in any context, but the other two forms are only acceptable in more and more restricted contexts,

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ccccc@{}}
      \hline
       & \textsc{discourse new} & \textsc{inferrable} & \textsc{discourse old}\\ \hline

      \textsc{\color{blue} neg V neg} & \#  & $\checkmark$ & $\checkmark$ \\

      \hline
\end{tabular}     
\end{center}
\caption{Acceptability of forms in discourse contexts}

\end{table}


It is not entirely clear if the forms of negation in Brazilian Portuguese should be treated differently than the canonical cases of embracing negation in Jespersen's Cycle (cf. \emph{ne...pas} in French, \emph{ne...not} in English). However, languages with only the pre-verbal and embracing form have been shown to exhibit this same sensitivity to discourse status (e.g. \cite{schwenter2006} for Catalan and Italian, \cite{hansen2009} for French). Namely, languages that only have two forms make the distinction between \textsc{discourse new} and everything else. This, of course raises the question of whether the post-verbal form is necessarily sensitive to discourse status or is the result of other processes, such as phonetic reduction. These are open empirical questions, which might also vary by the particular circumstances of a language.

However, the general shape of the conditioning factors suggests an intuitive characterization Jespersen's Cycle. That is, the different forms of negation are sensitive to the scale of how closely the negated proposition is connected to the discourse. That is, if we take connection to the discourse as a continuous measure, then discourse new propositions are at the low end, discourse old propositions are at the high end, and inferrable propositions are somewhere in the middle. In fact, we can simply reduce this to a scale of degrees of inferrability: discourse new propositions are not inferrable since we can't read minds, and discourse old propositions are completely inferrable since they have just been explicitly introduced into the discourse. 

We can represent this visually as in Figure \ref{continuum}, where we have simply taken the discrete categories used to construct Table \ref{schwenter} and treated them as a continuum. In fact, this wording is potentially misleading. If discourse status is about beliefs, then the underlying phenomenon is essentially gradient in nature. The discrete categories are useful because they correspond to portions of the continuum. While we have robust intuitions about the discrete categories, the varying strength of these intuitions suggests that the underlying phenomenon is essentially gradient in nature.

The continuous representation also offers us some insight into \emph{why} Jespersen's Cycle occurs. The reasoning is as follows. First, keeping track of what is actually part of the discourse is difficult. In fact, this is the problem of \emph{common knowledge}\footnote{In epistemic logic \emph{mutual knowledge} only requires that everyone know that $p$, without any further steps. Thus anything that is common knowledge is also mutual knowledge, but not \emph{vice versa}. \cite{lewis:1969} introduced common knowledge in Philosophy. \cite{clark-marshall1981} use the term ``mutual knowledge'' to refer to common knowledge.}, that everyone knows that $p$, that everyone knows that everyone knows that $p$, \emph{ad infinitum}. \cite{clark-marshall1981} outline a set of reasonable heuristics for circumventing this infinite regress, including physical or linguistic co-presence and community membership. While these heuristics are made with reference to resolving the problem of common knowledge, they extend equally to 
propositions. Namely, propositions can be introduced to the discourse either explicitly (linguistic co-presence) or implicitly (physical co-presence, community membership).

Second, we have ample experimental evidence that speakers have particular biases in communication. Speakers tend to overestimate how successful they are at communication. \cite{savitsky-etal:2011} had two pairs of friends participate in a simple communication task. All four participants sat back to back and were individually given lists of four-way ambiguous sentences to read out loud with a specified meaning. For example, the sentence ``It's getting hot in here.'' could be interpreted as an indirect request to open the window or an amorous advance. Participants were asked to do two things. They were asked to guess the intended meaning of the sentences spoken by the other participants. They were also asked to estimate how many of the sentences the friend they came with had guessed correctly, and how many sentences the strangers from the other pair had guessed correctly. 

The results can be seen in Figure \ref{savitsky}. Listeners were reliably above chance at guessing the intended meaning out of the four potential meanings, but, friends and strangers did not differ significantly. However, speakers had much higher expectations  for listeners, significantly overestimating how many sentences listeners would accurately guess. This suggests that, as speakers, we often tend to overestimate how transparent our utterances actually are to our listeners.

  \caption{Results from \cite{savitsky-etal:2011}}
   \label{savitsky}
\end{figure}


\cite{lane-etal2006} offer evidence that is particular germane to the question of discourse status. The experimental design can be seen in Figure \ref{elephants-exp}. Participants were assigned the role of either the speaker or addressee in a communication game. Speakers were instructed to communicate information about a target shape to the addressee. One shape was visible to only the speaker, blocked from the view of the addressee by an occluder. In the target conditions, the item that was visible only to the speaker was the same shape, but varied along some relevant dimension (e.g. size, color). Figure \ref{elephants-results} shows the proportion of trials where speakers used a modifier in referring to the target item. Surprisingly, speakers' privileged information leaks into what is said. In fact, this happens to an even greater extent when speakers were explicitly instructed to conceal information about their privileged information.

\end{figure}

Returning to Jespersen's Cycle, we note that these experimental findings suggest a potential explanation for \emph{why} change takes place. The embracing form is restricted to a particular set of contexts where the proposition being negated is discourse old, or highly inferrable. If speakers tend to overestimate how inferrable the proposition being negated is, if they fail to filter out their own privileged information, then they will tend to use the embracing form in less and less inferrable contexts. The result will be an increase in the frequency of the embracing form over time. \cite{ahern-clark2015} offer a formal model of the dynamics of this process. However, the predictions of the model, like the corpus work by \cite{hansen2009, hansen-visconti2009}, are largely qualitative. That is, they demonstrate that the different forms of negation are sensitive to different constraints at different points in time, and offer an explanation of why those constraints might change over time. However, they offer no 
quantitative predictions about the shape of the change.

In contrast, \cite{wallage2013} presents a quantitative analysis of the conditioning factors of Jesepersen's Cycle in Middle English, drawing on evidence from the Penn Parsed Corpus of Middle English \citep{ppcme2}. Wallage codes sentences containing sentential negation for the discourse status of the proposition being negated, according to the categories outlined above. From two separate statistical tests on binned data (1150-1250 and 1250-1350), Wallage argues that if we factor out the overall rate of the embracing form, the effect of discourse status is not different across the two time bins. While the argument is interesting and it has great merit in being quantitative, the methodology is not compelling. That is, Wallage uses a form of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_rules_analysis}{VARBRUL} and claims that the coefficients across discourse contexts are similar enough. There are several problems with this approach. First, it doesn't offer any way of quantitatively specifying how similar is 
similiar \emph{enough}. While regular practice may yield some insight, we want a statistical measure of how similar is similar enough to not reject the hypothesis that the conditioning of discourse status changes. Second, binning the data and not accounting for the potential effects of individual documents may yield misleading results. More appropriate methods, such as generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) would be more appropriate, and Wallage (p.c.) is moving towards the application of these new statistical techniques.

As it stands though, we don't have a clear answer to whether Jespersen's Cycle is driven by a sensitivity to discourse functional constraints. There are at least two potential explanations that reconcile the findings of \cite{hansen2009, hansen-visconti2009}, the experimental evidence of \cite{lane-etal2006}, the formal model of \cite{ahern-clark2015}, and the null result of \cite{wallage2013}. First, the role of discourse stats in Jespersen's Cycle may differ across languages. That is, the fact that the negation is sensitive to information structure may be particular to Romance languages. In fact, these constraints have only been noted in Romance languages. This could be the result of the constraints only occurring in Romance languages or just a lack of investigation into other languages synchronically and diachronically. The fact that the discourse status conditions in English don't change over time could be explained by this. However, it's striking that, at the beginning of the change, the embracing form 
in English is largely restricted to Inferrable and Discourse Old contexts. It would be surprising if this were a simple coincidence. Second, absent an explicit model of how and \emph{why} the discourse status constraints might be changing, the methodology employed by Wallage does not tell us much. That is, Wallage implicitly adopts the null hypothesis that the rate of change across discourse contexts is not different and argues that this null hypothesis cannot be rejected. However, it is not entirely clear what the null hypothesis ought to be, or if his method can actually tell us when we can reject it.

While we are still left with a fair amount of uncertainty regarding the actual causes of the cycle, it's clear that answering it will require a quantitative analysis of the conditioning factors of different forms of negation. The downside in this regard is that discourse status is not necessarily a surface property of sentences. That is, we cannot simply take a sentence and read off its relation to the previous discourse. Coding for discourse status requires a careful consideration of the prior context, the potential interpretations of a sentence, and general knowledge about the world.  This task is not straightforward even when analyzing contemporary language equipped with modern intuitions. The difficulty is only exacerbated when we turn to historical corpora. This leads to a reliance on expertise in the historical forms of a language to even perform a qualitative analysis, and a substantial investment of time and expertise to hand-code a large enough set of data to perform a quantitative statistical 
analysis. Unfortunately, this means that a comprehensive answer to the question of whether discourse constraints are important in Jespersen's Cycle is dependent on having experts in the history of multiple languages where the cycle has occurred invest a significant amount of time towards coding and evaluating the results. This is certainly possible, but also certainly a difficult task.

The goal of this project will be to explore methods for circumventing the need for significant expertise in the history of a language and significant time to understand the role of discourse status in change. In particular, we will be searching for surface properties of sentences that correlated with discourse status. On the assumption that these other surface properties stand in a stable relation to discourse status, we can probabilistically predict the discourse status of particular forms over time. That is, we are trying to infer the surface proxies of discourse status so that we can at least partially automate the process of determining the role of discourse in change. In the next section we describe the methods and data we will use.


\section{Future Directions}

This analysis suggests how Jespersen's Cycle can arise from signaling under a slight speaker bias. Examining the effect of these pragmatic pressures we established the following results. First, we showed that, for any amount of bias, emphatic forms become less informative over time. The extent of this loss is governed by the amount of bias, ranging from attenuation to complete bleaching. Second, only finitely many signals are stable in equilibrium for a given amount of bias.  The introduction of additional signals results in a push-chain scenario whereby the least informative signal is lost and the population returns to equilibrium. 

There are several further directions that remain to be explored. First, we have encoded a bias on the part of the speaker into the utility function. This gives rise to the inflationary effect whereby emphatic negation is attenuated. However, it is not clear that this effect need arise from the speaker's preferences. For example, it may be the case that it could equally as well arise from the speaker's uncertainty regarding the hearers beliefs about the distribution over standards of precision. Thus far, we have relied on the \emph{common prior assumption}, which allows for the reduction of games of incomplete information to games of imperfect information \citep{harsanyi:1967,harsanyi:1968a,harsanyi:1968b}. That is, we have assumed that both speaker and hearer share the same prior probability over standards of precision. This need not be the case, but it is an open question as to whether removing this restriction yields a qualitatively different result than the course pursued here. Further, given every 
individual's experience as both a sender and a hearer, the common prior assumption may be well justified.

Second, we have assumed a uniform prior distribution over the state space. This serves well enough as a starting point, but the interaction between distributions and biases may yield dramatically different constraints than those discussed above. A straightforward generalization could be had by considering the \emph{Beta Distribution} over the state space, of which the uniform distribution is a special case. This would allow for a wide ranging test of the interaction between the prior probability and the amount of information that can be conveyed. Finally, the generalization of the prior can be informed in part by an empirical investigation of how often emphatic negation actually occurs. For example, if, as we have suggested, emphatic negation arises from NPIs in focus then we should be able to estimate the overall rate of use by determining how often such NPIs bear the mark of an abstract focus feature. That is, we can compare the overall rate of negation to the occurrence of NPIs with prosodic prominence.  
While this only indirectly tells us about the underlying distribution of standards of precision, it provides a kind of constraint that will allow us to estimate likely distributions.

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Common prior assumption
%  \item Uncertainty over receiver type
%  \item Shape of prior
% \end{itemize}


% The introduction of signals at different points in a scale parallels the distinction between Jespersen's Cycle and the \emph{Quantifier Cycle} \citep{haspelmath1997}. That is, 

%  The result of introducing the new signal is a partially separating equilibrium where the signal with the lowest standard of interpretation is lost, but everything else is as before. To borrow a metaphor from sound change, the least informative signal is replaced by a \emph{push chain}. If new signals are coming in from above, then we would expect a 
% consistent transition down the standards of interpretation. However, this does not preclude the introduction of signals at other points on the scale. We would simply predict a different outcome.

Given an input sentence $s$, the learner selects a grammar $G_i$ with probability $p_i$:


\begin{equation}
 \mbox{If $G_i \rightarrow s$ then }
\left\{

		p_i'  = p_i + \gamma (1-p_i)\\
		p_j'  = (1-\gamma)p_j & \mbox{for} j \neq i

"it is imperative that the learner punish grammars that fail to analyze incoming sentences. A special case of the algorithm $L (L')$ can be called a \emph{tolerant} learner, in which if a grammar succeeds in analyzing a sentences, it is rewarded; otherwise nothing happens. A tolerant learner corresponds to the \emph{Linear-Interaction} scheme (Atkinson et al. 1965), which has quite different stochastic properties, e.g. convergence is not always guaranteed." Yang 1999 p.14

Linear Reward-Inaction schema is known to be e-optimal \citep{narendra2012}

I'm working with a differential equation that is a logistic growth function with a carrying capacity and a varying growth rate, where $p, \alpha, \beta \in [0,1]$.

$\frac{dp}{dt} = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{(1-p)\alpha + p\beta}$

 The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ determine the sign of the growth rate. If $\beta > \alpha$ then the growth rate is positive, if $\beta < \alpha$ then the growth rate is negative.

Integrating and taking antilogarithms we get the following, where $K$ comes from a constant of integration. 
 
 $\frac{p^\alpha}{(1-p)^\beta} = Ke^{(\beta - \alpha)t}$

Assuming that the $p = p_0$ at $t = 0$.

$K = \frac{p_0^\alpha}{(1-p_0)^\beta}$

I'm not sure how to use this to find a particular solution for $p$. In particular, I'm not sure how to deal with the exponents. Is there a way to solve for $p$? 

One potential route to take, would be to simplify the denominator in the growth rate of the original equation and consider the two simplified equations.

$\frac{dp}{dt} = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{\alpha}$

$\frac{dp}{dt} = p(1-p)\frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta}$

with particular solutions where $K =\frac{p_0}{(1-p_0)}$

$p = \frac{Ke^{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}t}}{Ke^{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}t} + e^t}$

$p = \frac{Ke^t}{Ke^t + e^{\frac{\alpha}{\beta}t}}$

If $\beta > \alpha$ then the growth rate for the first simplified equation is always greater than the second simplified equation, and the solution to the original equation will be somewhere in between these two. Is there a straightforward way to interpolate between these two solutions?


\chapter{Stability}
\label{Stability}



The analysis presented in the previous section suggests that pragmatic pressures can lead to the increase in the use of a postverbal negator. The question is then why this increase so often leads to the loss of the preverbal negator. If, at some point, the postverbal negator comes to be negative in its own right, then this clearly impinges on the process of acquisition. Learners are faced with the problem of determining what exactly expresses negation. Here we examine how use and acquisition might allow for the transition from preverbal negation to postverbal negation. We consider whether the two mechanisms can independently bring about the change, or whether they must act in concert to destabilize the current system of negation.

At the heart of this question is the amount of evidence that a given element expresses negation. At the beginning of the change clearly only the preverbal negator does so. The postverbal reinforcer only emphasizes this negation. Eventually though, the evidence weighs in favor of the postverbal negator alone being the expression of negation. \cite{wallage2008} characterizes this transition in morphosyntactic terms as the loss of a [+NEG] feature on the preverbal negator, along with the concomitant introduction of a [+NEG] feature on the postverbal negator. This then allows for the loss of the preverbal negator given that the negative feature can be found elsewhere in the sentence.

We can formulate the effect of various amounts of evidence in terms of Yang's \citeyearpar{yang:2002} variational model. First, let there be two grammars, $G_{ne}$ and $G_{not}$, that represent the location of the abstract feature at \emph{ne} and \emph{not} respectively. We can represent the relation between the two grammars schematically as in Figure \ref{grammars}. In this case, $\alpha$ indicates the proportion of the linguistic environment that is only compatible with $G_{ne}$, and $\beta$ indicates the portion of the linguistic environment that is only compatible with $G_{not}$. The proportion of the two grammars in the population is governed by the following learning rule, where $p_0$ and $p_t$ represent the proportion of $G_{ne}$ in the population after $0$ and $t$ generations, and $q_0$ and $q_t$ represent the proportion of $G_{not}$ after $0$ and $t$ generations.

\begin{equation}
     \frac{q_t}{p_t} = \left( \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \right)^t\frac{q_0}{p_0}
\end{equation}

On the standard version of the model, if $\beta \neq \alpha$, then one grammar or the other will win out. Thus, we would expect that starting from a given point in time an incoming grammar would only spread if it had more initial evidence in favor of it. However, this rests on the assumption that no mechanisms other than acquisition are acting on the distribution of forms. Our analysis thus far suggests that this need not be the case.

Here we consider the two mechanisms that might factor into the trajectory of the change. First, the increase of postverbal negation directly impacts the change insofar as it diminishes $\alpha$. Second, there are instances of $ne$ that provide evidence that it does not bear the negative feature, rendering $\beta$ nonzero.  Both mechanisms alone, or in combination can be used to make predictions about the trajectory of the change over time. We consider each mechanism in isolation and then in tandem, determining whether either is sufficient   to cause the change in isolation.

As noted in the previous section, the use of the postverbal negator spreads up to a point, which is determined by the bias of the speaker. At the most, this can result in the reduction of $\alpha$ to $0$. That is, if $ne...not$ is the only form of negation ever used, then there is equal evidence that $ne$ and $not$ express negation. That is, there is no reason why we would expect one form to replace the other. This means that pragmatic pressures are not sufficient in isolation to affect the change. Rather, there must be some precursors that pave the way for the change. This is an interesting, but arguably welcome limitation to the scope of pragmatic pressures. Use can only do so much.  Similarly, unless the evidence is already in favor of $not$ as the expression of negation there is no chance that the change will go through. That is, neither change is sufficient to bring about the change on its own. However, together, the two offer insight into how the change takes place.

We consider how increased use of the postverbal negator might interact independent evidence that $not$ is the expression of negation. Namely, we consider the appearance of all forms in environments that license the appearance of negative polarity items, which are indicative of the lack of the abstract negative feature. These include the scope of negation, certain positions in comparative constructions, antecedents of conditionals (when not expressing actual negation), the restrictor of universal quantifiers, in the scope of verbs of doubting, in embedded clauses under negation, and direct and indirect questions \citep{ladusaw1979, giannakidou1998}. This simply reflects the intuition that NPIs are associated with some negative feature, but not negative in their own right. Occurrence outside these environments can be taken as evidence for the abstract feature. Thus, for both the preverbal and postverbal negators, the amount of evidence that they bear the abstract feature can easily be found for at least some 
of these categories from a corpus. \cite{wallage2008} gives occurrences of the various forms of negation from the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English (PPCME2) \citep{ppcme2}  in main clauses, subordinate clauses, \emph{if}-clauses, and in the scope of negation.

Taken together, we can estimate the amount of evidence over time for and against the two grammars. That is, those occurrences of a particular form by itself in a main or a subordinate clause constitute positive evidence for its respective grammar, whereas those occurrences of a particular form in the scope of negation constitute positive evidence for the other grammar. It is not clear whether all the instances of negation in the antecedent of conditionals express negation, so here we leave them out of our counts. The change in the relative evidence across time can be seen in Table \ref{evidence}. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}cccccc@{}}
\hline
Period & $\alpha$ & $\beta$ & $\frac{\beta}{\alpha}$ & \emph{ne...not}\\

1250-1350 & 137 & 65 & .474 & 490\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption{Relative evidence for grammars}
\label{evidence}
\end{center}
\end{table}

At some point during the transition from the second to the third period there is a clear tipping point in the amount of evidence for the two grammars. $ne$ goes from being favored as the host of the negative feature to being grossly disfavored. Note that this transition coincides with the peak usage of \emph{ne...not}, suggesting that the increasing use of postverbal negation continued up until a certain point, rendering $not$ the uncontested expression of negation. Both use and acquisition play there parts in bringing about the change.

Now, while this evidence is suggestive, it still leaves the appearance of $not$ by itself a mystery. This follows from the fact that the variational model is not a model of actuation itself. To see this note that the grammar must already be in existence for it to grow. That is, if $q_0 = 0$ then $q_1=0$.

\begin{equation}
     \frac{q_1}{p_1} = \left( \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \right)\frac{q_0}{p_0}
\end{equation}
One possible way of making sense of this actuation stems from the phonetic weight of the preverbal negator. That is, as the postverbal negator increases in frequency, even a small probability of misperceiving the preverbal negator as absent provides evidence for the change, and, importantly, the ultimate loss of the preverbal negator. It might be possible to infer the impact of these misperceptions over time given the predicted dynamics of the learning model. That is, the proportion of a given grammar must exceed a threshold to keep from being effectively washed out by one generation. We can test how a small error rate in misperceptions might counteract this force, and, along with the steady increase in postverbal negation, bring about the eventual loss of the preverbal negator. 


Starting in Early Middle English, we find the transition from preverbal to embracing negation taking place.\footnote{Aaron Ecay kindly shared this data. Tokens are drawn from the \href{http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/}{Penn Parsed Corpus of Middle English}, ranging from roughly 1100 to 1500.}  We can trace the proportion of different forms over time as in Figure \ref{neg-three-plot}. Each circle represents tokens in a year. The size of the circle represents the number of tokens negative declaratives. The height of the circle represents the proportion of those instances that are a particular form. Locally-weighted regression lines are fit to these proportions.

\begin{figure}
\centering
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{neg-three-plot.pdf}
\caption{Proportion of forms of negation in Negative Declaratives}
\label{neg-three-plot}
\end{figure}

We see the transition from \emph{ne} to \emph{ne...not} starting from around the 12th century. Following close behind, we see the transition from \emph{ne...not} to \emph{not} even before the embracing form goes to completion.

The distribution of tokens over time is shown in Figure \ref{neg-hist-all}. The tokens are binned by decade, showing that the data is fairly sparse early on. We'll start by carving the data up into equal time bins of fixed width. We'll start with two time bins, and keep making finer and finer distinctions.

 \end{figure}
 
 There are two potential comparisons we might make in the data. First, we can compare the proportion of \emph{ne} to both of the other forms. This obscures some of the detail of the later change, but leaves us with more data. Second, we can compare the proportion of \emph{ne} to just the proportion of \emph{ne...not}. This allows for a clearer comparison, but also presents us with noisy data as both \emph{ne} and \emph{ne...not} become increasingly rare. We'll have to decide where to stop the comparison. Ideally, both comparisons will yield the same unequivocal result. 
 

We'll start by lumping the two later forms together. The results can be seen in Figure \ref{two-lump-plot}. The results for the tests can be seen in Table \ref{two-lump-table}.\footnote{For some reason, I'm having trouble running tsinfer! I'll add these results later.} In this case, there's fairly clear evidence for selection regardless of how we bin the data.

Now, we'll leave out the tokens of the final postverbal form and just compare the proportion of \emph{ne} and \emph{ne...not}. The results of doing so for the entire time period can be seen in Figure \ref{two-leave-plot}. The trend of the change is fairly clear up until 1400, where it reverses trend. Looking back at Figure \ref{neg-three-plot}, we find that this is when both forms we are comparing are rare. It seems reasonable to exclude all data after \emph{ne} and \emph{ne...not} cease to be the combined majority variant. The result of doing so can be seen in Figure \ref{two-leave-trim-plot}.

Since there are only seven unique years in the data once we have excluded years past the point where \emph{ne} and \emph{ne...not} are the combined majority variant, we can at most make seven bins. The results from doing so are in Table \ref{two-leave-trim-table}. As with the comparison above, there is good evidence for selection.

Here we test for drift versus selection in \emph{Jespersen's Cycle} in Middle English. In our original analysis, two documents written by Chaucer were dated as 1300. Since Chaucer was born around 1340, this would be impossible. Correcting the dates of these documents actually makes the overall trajectory of the cycle a bit clearer, and yields some potentially interesting results. In Section \ref{Drift} we compare different ways of using the data and the results of the \emph{Fitness Increment Test}. In section \ref{Dates} we consider whether the dates from the corpus reflect information or are artifacts of our uncertainty. In Section \ref{Conclusion} we contrast these results to the case of \emph{do}-support. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Summary:}  We find some evidence that the first transition in the cycle is due to selection (\textsc{\color{red} neg Verb} $\rightarrow$ \textsc{\color{blue} neg Verb neg}). We do not find sufficient evidence under the assumptions of the Gaussian Approxmiation of the diffusion equation to reject the null hypothesis that the second transition is due to drift (\textsc{\color{blue} neg Verb neg} $\rightarrow$ \textsc{\color{green} Verb neg})


\section{Drift}
\label{Drift}


Starting in Early Middle English, we find the transition from preverbal to embracing negation taking place. We can trace the proportion of different forms over time as in Figure \ref{neg-three-plot}. Each circle represents tokens in a year. The size of the circle represents the number of tokens negative declaratives. The height of the circle represents the proportion of those instances that are a particular form. Locally-weighted regression lines are fit to these proportions. We see the transition from \textit{\color{red} ne} to \textit{\color{blue} ne...not} starting from around the 12th century. Following close behind, we see the transition from \textit{\color{blue} ne...not} to \textit{\color{green} not} in the 14th century.

\begin{figure}
\centering
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{neg-year-lines.pdf}
\caption{Proportion of forms of negation in Negative Declaratives}
\label{neg-three-plot}
\end{figure}

There are at least two decisions to be made when dealing with the data, which correspond roughly with the ways we'll go about analyzing the data.

First, we have to decide what data should be compared. For example, if we are trying to determine if the first transition is due to selection, should we compare \textit{\color{red} ne} to \textit{\color{blue} ne...not} or should we compare \textit{\color{red} ne} to \textit{\color{blue} ne...not} and \textit{\color{green} not} grouped together? If we do the former, it's pretty clear that the variation beyond 1350 has less to do with the selection of \textit{\color{red} ne} versus \textit{\color{blue} ne...not}, but rather with\textit{\color{green} not} becoming the majority variant. Taking the latter route, and lumping \textit{\color{blue} ne...not} and \textit{\color{green} not} together for the sake of comparison solves this problem.

Second, we have to decide the period of time in which the comparison is being made. This offers another solution to the problem posed above. Namely, if we only compare \textit{\color{red} ne} to \textit{\color{blue} ne...not} prior to 1350 or so we don't have to worry about any noisy  data after that point. There are some natural reasons for choosing a cut-off point. For example, if we are only comparing \textit{\color{red} ne} and \textit{\color{blue} ne...not}, it would seem reasonable to only compare them  when together they constitute the majority of the tokens for a given year. For both transitions, we have the same exact point at 1350, which means we'll be using these tokens for both sets of tests.

We'll try both ways of analyzing the data. First, we'll lump the forms together comparing the pre-verbal to the embracing and post-verbal form, and the pre-verbal and embracing forms to the post-verbal form. We'll do this with all of the data. Second, we'll split the variants, only comparing two forms at a time, before and after 1350.

\subsection{Lumping}

The proportion of \textit{\color{blue} ne...not} and \textit{\color{green} not} forms combined over time can be seen in Figure \ref{lump-plot1}. The results of running the FIT on variable-width bins is shown in Table \ref{lump-table1}. For any binning finer than nine, we find either that an absorption event occurs or there are non-unique ways of binning the data by quantiles.

Together, these results suggest the following. First, in some cases we can reject the null hypothesis of drift in favor of selection for the first transition (Table \ref{lump-table1}). Second, we never find sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis for the second transition (Table \ref{lump-table2}). Finally, we should note that  the increments for the second transition are not normally distributed as we bin more finely.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Splitting}

If we choose to split the date by date, we limit the number of tokens available and thus how finely we can bin. The proportion of \textit{\color{blue} ne...not}  versus \textit{\color{red} ne} forms over time can be seen in Figure \ref{split-plot1}. The results of running the FIT on variable-width bins is shown in Table \ref{split-table1}. Binning the data into more than six bins is not possible due to either  non-uniquely defined bins, or absorption events. This is not altogether surprising, given that we can only manage eight or so bins with all of the data, as we did above.

\section{Dates}
\label{Dates}

Given that we have limited data we can't bin too finely, otherwise we run into one of two problems. Either we have an absorption event where all of the tokens are of one kind or another, or we have non-uniquely defined quantiles, we have no motivated way of splitting things up. An important question is whether these dates reflect information or are simply artifacts of uncertainty. That is, are documents dated 1225 really from 1225, or are they simply our best guess using quarter centuries?

Figure \ref{auth-plot} shows the number of documents per year. There are two important things to note. First, the documents are clustered around salient dates, roughly every quarter century. Second, we have more documents as time goes by and these are less concentrated at quarter century marks.

\begin{figure}
\centering
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{auth-plot.pdf}
\caption{Count of documents by year}
\label{auth-plot}
\end{figure}

We can try to adjust for the possibility that dates clustered around quarter century marks are artifacts rather than information by adding a small amount of noise to the date for each document. The amount of noise is uniformly distributed over $[-.5, .5 ]$. This means that documents clustered around quarter centuries will be randomly disaggregated, but no documents that are dated in unique years will be swapped in order. The upside of this is that we can simulate what would happen if we had more information about the dates of the documents.

\subsection{Lumping}

Disaggregating the data in this way allows us to bin more finely, but it doesn't shed too much more light on either transition, as we see in Tables \ref{jitter-lump-table1} and \ref{jitter-lump-table2}. For the most part, the resolution we gain from disaggregating the data is counterbalanced by the increments not being normally distributed

\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}

We have two ways of analyzing the data depending on what we compare, and how we compare it.
For the first comparison we find sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis for the first, but not the second transition. For the second comparison we do not find sufficient evidence to reject drift in either transition. These results hold for the analysis where we lump forms to gather to make a comparison when we add noise to document dates.

Now, we might ask whether there is any reason to choose one way of analyzing the data over the other. Given that the second  transition is not a necessary consequence of the first transition, we might consider the following reasons for lumping forms together. Namely, if the second transition had not occurred, then the embracing form would have gone to completion. That is, the signature of selection in the first transition is obscured by the fact that the second transition takes place. We can correct for this by treating the post-verbal forms \emph{as if} they were embracing forms. The results for the second transition are the same regardless of the analysis. However, again, given that the second transition does not necessarily follow from the first, it seems reasonable to treat pre-verbal forms \emph{as if} they were embracing.

The difference between Jespersen's Cycle and \emph{do}-support is largely one of sample size. There are only 51 unique documents for the period covered by Jespersen's Cycle, whereas there are hundreds for the time period of \emph{do}-support. This is striking for two reasons. First, while we might think of negation as a very frequent phenomenon, we are still limited by historical records. There are just fewer tokens the further back in historical time we go. Second, the assumption of normally distributed increments, which underlies the Gaussian approximation to the diffusion process, becomes an issue. In those cases where the rescaled increments are not normally distributed, the non-parametric version of the FIT sometimes rejects the null hypothesis.  \cite{steinrucken-etal2014} propose a method that does not rely on the Gaussian approximation, but is more computationally tractable than simulating the original approximation to the diffusion process.



\section{Future Directions}

The evidence presented suggests how the cycle depends on both use and acquisition. However, it is far from a complete picture. First, an extensive analysis of the various forms of negation in the PPCME2 will be necessary, both for a more accurate estimate of the evidence for both respective grammars, as well as an overview of the details concerning the various forms of negative elements, including other NPIs, negative adverbs, and negative quantifiers. Second, the relevant grammatical description of the change presented here is quite simplified relative to the more articulated approach discussed in \cite{wallage2008}. Namely, he divides the change in negation into finer parts. $ne$ goes from having interpretable [$i$neg] to an uninterpretable [$u$neg] negative feature. Such an analysis could be incorporated into the learning model presented here and might possibly shed light on the loss of $ne$ and other subsequent changes such as the loss of negative concord. Finally, the analysis of the cycle in Middle 
English could benefit greatly from a comparative perspective. The cycle in French differs widely in terms of both the relevant timeline and the evidence available at the onset of the change. Data from the MCVF Corpus of Middle French \citep{mcvf} could offer an important counterpoint and testing ground for the models presented thus far.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Pragmatic competence shapes the input to language acquisition, language acquisition gives rise to grammatical competence, and grammatical competence determines the set of signals at the disposal of our pragmatic competence. The goal of this dissertation is to advance our understanding of the relationship between the two as repeated in Figure \ref{second}. By loosening the assumption of perfectly common interests between speakers and hearers, we can gain insight into how the use of linguistic signals changes over time, and how this impacts acquisition. By generalizing the Gricean program we have been able to situate Jespersen's Cycle at the intersection of both. Neither by itself can account for the trajectory of the cycle, but both taken together are mutually informing and revealing.

But, these are not all available texts, but rather a selection that was thought to be representative of "good" French (Grieves-Smith, p. 125)

As described in the previous chapter, the corpus that we have does not include examples of ne ... pas, ne ... point or ne ... mie used for literal reference, scalar denial or emphatic denial. I therefore tagged each instance of sentence negation for the features predicate negation, proposition denial and presupposition denial. (p.134)

Englishman John Palsgrave, who published a grammar in 1530. He wrote (Palsgrave 1530: 110):
For where as they put ne before theyr verbes, so often as they expresse negation, like as we use 'nat' in our tong after our verbes. They put also after theyr verbes pas, poynt or mye, whiche of theym selfe signifye nothyng, but onely be as signes of negation.

In sum, our findings for the eighteenth-century corpora lead us to hypothesize that in eighteenth-century popular spoken French the rate of ne deletion rose only modestly and that it started in sentences with a clitic subject. In other words, if we consider, along with Schwegler (1988), that deletion of the preverbal negator is the final stage in the cyclical evolution of negation in Romance languages, our findings suggest that, as far as French is concerned, the starting point of this ultimate stage is sentences with a subject clitic. The fact that clitic subjects can be phonetically weakened and are unstressed may be the reason for this.

The hypothesis that the social and structural diffusion of ne deletion has proceeded at a faster pace in Quebec than in France is consistent with the fact that in the late twentieth century, ne deletion was found to be almost categorical in all syntactic contexts and in the speech of different social groups in Quebec French, but was still associated with differential patterns of structural, social, and geographic diffusion in European French, (see Pohl 1975, Sankoff \& Vincent 1977, Ashby 1981, and Coveney 1996).41

(1) 9th to 13th centuries: stable period (ne is used alone or is reinforced by words like pas or point that do not have yet a negative meaning; subject clitics are optional) (2) 14th to 16th centuries: unstable period (ne is vying with ne . . . pas/point to
express negation; PRO drop is on the decrease)
(3) 17th and 18th centuries: stable period (ne . . . pas/point is firmly established as
the expression of negation; PRO drop is exceptional)
(4) 19th and 20th centuries: unstable period (ne . . . pas and pas are vying with
each other, with pas eventually winning out; affixation of subject clitics is firmly established).53

Interestingly, Eckardt (2007: 257-260) observes that in her data, point 'displays the most varied sample of "puzzling" uses.' On this basis, she suggests that by the time of Classical French, ne ... point may have been the last grammaticized negator to lose its 'emphatic' status, consistent with the findings of Catalani (2001). As I will discuss in the Results chapter, this is confirmed in the present study.

Before metanalysis, the negative meaning is attributed to the preverbal particle ne, and the emphatic function is attributed to the postverbal element (pas, personne, etc.). From the point of view of the postverbal element, negation is a contextual feature while emphasis is an inherent feature. However, as has been argued by a number of linguists (e.g. Schwegler 1988: 36, Givn 1979, ch. 3), negative utterances are more likely to be emphatic in actual use than positive ones; that is, there is a high degree of correlation between negation and emphasis. This correlation sets the condition for metanalysis: since the emphatic element is found frequently in negative contexts, and negative contexts are frequently emphatic, there is a swapping of the two functions: the negative function is attributed to the emphatic element, while the emphatic function is attributed to the nonlinguistic context.

Traugott (1989) and others argue that semantic change typically proceeds gradually through polysemy and ambiguity, driven by the conventionalization of pragmatic inferences. She identifies three tendencies of semantic change based on her investigation of English modal auxiliaries (1989: 34-35):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Meanings based in the external described situation $>$ meanings based in the internal (evaluative/perceptual/cognitive) described situation.
	\item Meanings based in the external or internal described situation $>$ meanings based in the textual and metalinguistic situation.
	\item Meanings tend to become increasingly based in the speaker's subjective belief state/attitude toward the proposition.
\end{enumerate}
