This repository contains the contents of my dissertation completed in 2015 in
 the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu).
[Robin Clark](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~rclark/Site/Welcome.html) supervised the dissertation and

committee.
